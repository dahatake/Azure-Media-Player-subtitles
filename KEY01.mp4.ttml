      <p begin="00:01:42.110" end="00:01:50.720">In fact it goes back to the very origin of our company.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:53.950">Microsoft was founded by two developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.610" end="00:02:00.430">Who had a bold ambition to empower other</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.430" end="00:02:04.090">developers to build new great thanks?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.330" end="00:02:09.310">In fact ...you see on the screen.</p>

      <p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:33.160">...nice comment about we should put better errors so, it started in the very beginning.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:37.250">When you look at it that?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.250" end="00:02:38.000">...costs.</p>

      <p begin="00:03:31.770" end="00:03:39.310">it starts by empowering every developer on the planet?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:43.630">What you ...hear us talk about in this conference and even in this</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.630" end="00:03:48.540">morning's keynote is perhaps the broadest lens through which we</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:55.690">viewed developers development and platforms?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.690" end="00:04:00.590">We're going to want developers from student developers to start ops</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.590" end="00:04:04.600">...enterprise developers to ISV to people writing mobile</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.600" end="00:04:09.330">...people venturing into virtual reality in mixed reality</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.330" end="00:04:13.800">all of these developers to calm exploit take advantage of</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.800" end="00:04:23.010">the platform innovation that you will see this morning and throughout this conference.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:26.350">Want to make sure that we build bridges</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.350" end="00:04:29.720">...we want you to be able to bring your</p>

      <p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:38.510">to our platforms and then build from there new and great</p>

      <p begin="00:04:41.590" end="00:04:44.300">Concept of that approach.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:44.300" end="00:04:45.520">Is something that's going to</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:54.880">be deeply ingrained in everything we do across all of our platforms?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:59.130">Over the last year I've had a chance to talk to many developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.540" end="00:05:03.270">Throughout the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:06.790">I met a couple student developers student developers who won the imagine</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06.790" end="00:05:10.470">crop last year from australia labeled</p>
      <p begin="00:05:10.470" end="00:05:13.800">...fantastic mobile app.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.800" end="00:05:15.050">That it made it possible.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.140" end="00:05:19.050">For you to be able to detect.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:19.050" end="00:05:23.360">Anemia and children by just using a simple</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:27.540">lap and taking a ...and that at now is</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.540" end="00:05:31.370">changing lives in africa and other developing parts of the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:35.720">I had a chance to meet a middle school or in the wrong single who</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.720" end="00:05:38.740">built a robot that could walk the stairs</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.740" end="00:05:45.380">in our eyes I could see that was just the very beginning of what she's going to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.380" end="00:05:49.010">I have a chance to meet the enterprise developers in germany working in an</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.010" end="00:05:53.070">industrial equipment manufacturer and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.070" end="00:05:56.570">they will fundamentally changing transforming the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.570" end="00:06:03.270">business to becoming a software company as fast company.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.270" end="00:06:06.550">So, I thought that is perhaps appropriate.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.620" end="00:06:09.000">To kick-off billed.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.090" end="00:06:15.060">By talking to one such developer.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.060" end="00:06:18.420">In fact he's a musician.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.420" end="00:06:20.210">Who had a dream?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.210" end="00:06:21.000">And, the columns of</p>
      <p begin="00:06:21.000" end="00:06:25.330">...accidental developer who had a dream.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.330" end="00:06:26.640">To change.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.640" end="00:06:30.920">How music is composed?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:30.920" end="00:06:36.610">Please help me welcome david william ...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:41.570">Hi, david my great senior great to be ...thanks for coming</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.570" end="00:06:46.310">...why do you tell us a little bit about your dream your journey so far</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.310" end="00:06:50.960">absolutely so music notation is probably something that a lot of you in this room</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:55.870">haven't really thought about before but it really is the written language of music it's almost like a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.870" end="00:07:00.410">coding language of music actually in fact it has some similarities with code you can even</p>
      <p begin="00:07:00.410" end="00:07:06.250">...and CSharp or upshot of shops probably better for that very.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:06.250" end="00:07:10.160">...until now there's been two main ways you can really write music</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:14.390">traditionally using pattern paper which is very creative maybe not that</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.390" end="00:07:19.250">convenience sometimes or the digital way which is very laborious</p>
      <p begin="00:07:19.250" end="00:07:24.150">through input but very convenient once it's in that form so I really wanted to make something where you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:26.740">could take the creativity and the convenience and</p>
      <p begin="00:07:26.740" end="00:07:31.690">smashing together and create this brand new way of writing music amazing do you want to show us what you</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.690" end="00:07:42.840">built absolutely ...stuff that is handwriting recognition for ...notation.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:42.840" end="00:07:45.930">But, I've actually been working on a piece the last few weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.930" end="00:07:47.420">A piece of string quartet and piano.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:51.350">And, as you can see I can use touch to interact with the school you can see we've got a</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.350" end="00:07:54.890">big school here this is note nursery rhyme.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.290" end="00:08:01.080">And, let's go to the end we got a couple of bus left to do so I figured we could finish it up on stage</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.080" end="00:08:07.490">...sure your doctor music electric but go ahead how ...the company.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:12.940">Ok, let's just take the pen I'm going to start writing in the bars</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.940" end="00:08:23.510">so it's very natural the idea behind the app was that if you could write music should be able to a?</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.510" end="00:08:28.130">Here if you can write music you should be able to know-how to use the app you don't need to really learn too much</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.130" end="00:08:32.240">...very intuitive as I move into the next bar.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:34.040">Music notation is recognized intended to</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.040" end="00:08:37.809">...thank you moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:51.230">But, actually this is actually interactive notation now so I can ...to cut it up.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.230" end="00:08:53.950">And, maybe I should slur some of these two.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.950" end="00:08:58.460">You think swimming's play like you drunk okay I'm getting so much trouble ...</p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.460" end="00:09:02.230">Using touch I can double ...the bar select the bar and just pull this out</p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.230" end="00:09:07.210">this is a great thing about surface and windows was really the only platform that we could do this for because it really</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07.210" end="00:09:12.150">understands the difference between my fingers and the pen and that key that's really key to</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.150" end="00:09:18.660">making this into to the natural I'm just going to say this last beat ...that using the ...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:24.550">And, I'm going to draw in a string run here.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:24.550" end="00:09:28.700">And, pull that up and you can see that we've got a nice flash ...up to the top</p>
      <p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:32.320">so let me just to one less thing double type copy this down.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.400" end="00:09:35.610">That's cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.610" end="00:09:38.290">So, ...on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:46.060">...and, we can play this back.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.060" end="00:09:52.160">They go towards the ...of offset.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:55.590">What's ...the reaction I know that this has been out for a few months is</p>
      <p begin="00:09:55.590" end="00:10:00.260">...now ...just a few weeks and weeks on the ...is already been absolutely incredible</p>
      <p begin="00:10:00.260" end="00:10:04.890">breathtaking really we've heard from people all over the world we have an eleven-year-old composer</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.890" end="00:10:09.630">he's writing her second up-front on the app model first second</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.630" end="00:10:14.870">and ninety one-year-old ...back in love with writing music and it's really been this students</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.870" end="00:10:19.420">using the classroom to classroom and it's really just an incredible reaction has been</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.420" end="00:10:28.470">...also thank you so much to me ...lot.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.470" end="00:10:32.680">That's what's most striking about today's developers and all of you</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.680" end="00:10:37.580">which is one person or a small group of people with ...dream</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37.580" end="00:10:42.330">and a passion can have such huge impact.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42.330" end="00:10:47.090">By taking advantage of these platform technologies who have thought that music</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.090" end="00:10:51.970">composition can be changed with touch in ink and that's what we live</p>
      <p begin="00:10:51.970" end="00:10:56.920">for as a platform company we want to be able to take inspiration from the apps</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.920" end="00:11:02.680">you build drive platform innovation so today's keynote</p>

      <p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:07.790">shifts.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.830" end="00:11:11.510">We want to talk about first.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.510" end="00:11:13.580">Our cloud platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:13.580" end="00:11:15.810">We aspire to build.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:15.810" end="00:11:19.560">An intelligent cloud back-end for the world's</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.560" end="00:11:25.020">applications running on all devices we want to have.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:25.020" end="00:11:26.930">The capability to manage</p>
      <p begin="00:11:26.930" end="00:11:31.740">infrastructures spanning datacenters so that means storage ...</p>
      <p begin="00:11:31.740" end="00:11:33.590">...the network that's not just</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.590" end="00:11:37.990">about a datacenter as a computer but all of the data centers coming</p>
      <p begin="00:11:37.990" end="00:11:42.770">together in support of these intelligent applications we want to have</p>
      <p begin="00:11:42.770" end="00:11:47.440">rich applications services input particular data services such</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:52.160">as machine learning and democratize the taxes to those capabilities so</p>
      <p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:58.920">that every developer on every platform can build intelligent apps.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:58.920" end="00:12:02.390">Second we want to talk about office as a platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:03.500" end="00:12:05.970">We want to move far beyond.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.970" end="00:12:09.600">Individual applications and their API.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:12.400">To building ...rich.</p>

      <p begin="00:12:15.800" end="00:12:21.190">We want you to be able to consume that graph extend that</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.190" end="00:12:22.510">graph.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:22.510" end="00:12:28.110">And, we'll talk a lot about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.110" end="00:12:31.480">We want to talk about windows.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.480" end="00:12:33.340">Windows ten.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33.340" end="00:12:38.240">Represents a new generation of windows built.</p>

      <p begin="00:12:48.440" end="00:12:54.840">the experience is what matters not the mobility of the device.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:54.840" end="00:12:59.000">Sort of kick things off let me have scott got three come up</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59.000" end="00:13:10.350">...stage and talk about cloud platform thank you very much.</p>

      <p begin="00:17:39.490" end="00:17:43.750">in a very deep way and over this past year in particular we've taken a number</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43.750" end="00:17:48.680">of significant steps to use open-source even more broadly last year we</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48.680" end="00:17:52.690">announced plans to deeply embrace darker and darker ecosystem</p>

      <p begin="00:18:35.150" end="00:18:40.570">So, for those of you who are not aware doctor has just celebrated its second birthday so, freely</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40.570" end="00:18:45.950">we're used to thinking of ...kind of like human two-year-old, you know, occasionally stumbles occasionally</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.950" end="00:18:51.500">spits up and keeps those of us who are closest to it up at night and, ...of surprising to be up here</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51.500" end="00:18:57.080">on stage it failed in fact I talk about the five big surprises that we've had in working with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.080" end="00:19:01.930">microsoft at all or ...ways relate to this notion of how we can take openness</p>
      <p begin="00:19:01.930" end="00:19:07.170">and portability and flexibility and use it to empower developers now if you're not familiar with</p>
      <p begin="00:19:07.170" end="00:19:09.100">...started two years ago by solomon</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.100" end="00:19:14.030">hikes who felt that developers fundamentally are spending far too much of their time.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.030" end="00:19:18.090">Doing rework worrying about dependencies worrying about servers instead of just building</p>
      <p begin="00:19:18.090" end="00:19:22.120">awesome maps and initial innovation was let's make it possible to</p>
      <p begin="00:19:22.120" end="00:19:26.640">take any application and it's dependencies package them up in the digital equivalent of</p>
      <p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:31.320">a shipping container enable any application that stock rise to interact with any other</p>
      <p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:35.090">...rise application and run any server ...october when we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:35.090" end="00:19:40.200">went up to meet with microsoft we're very proud of the fact we got networking for linux</p>
      <p begin="00:19:40.200" end="00:19:45.010">you could take any linux application doc ...run it on any linux server and quite frankly we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:45.010" end="00:19:49.900">saw we leaves redmond with an agreement to make soccer for linux run well on hyper</p>
      <p begin="00:19:49.900" end="00:19:54.790">...or run well in manager but then we have the first of those big five surprises and</p>
      <p begin="00:19:54.790" end="00:19:59.260">the first big surprise was that we were not going to work on doctor for linux we're going to work on</p>
      <p begin="00:19:59.260" end="00:20:02.690">doctor for windows so we're going to enable the four million</p>
      <p begin="00:20:02.690" end="00:20:05.290">doctor linux developers to join all the millions</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05.290" end="00:20:09.500">...developers and make it possible using standard darker</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.500" end="00:20:13.860">using open-source to take any windows application doc</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.860" end="00:20:19.540">...and run it on any server second great surprise that we had was this is not only</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19.540" end="00:20:24.540">about code was also about content collaboration you're familiar with doctor, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:24.540" end="00:20:29.440">we have a service called doctor hub that has about a ...twenty thousand doc rise gaps.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:32.890">Microsoft has not only integrated darker ...into all of</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.890" end="00:20:37.490">its developer platforms but is contributing actively to doctor hub not just</p>
      <p begin="00:20:37.490" end="00:20:41.760">...windows components but all of these great new open-source dot net for</p>
      <p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.910">linux components delivered again is doctor containers to the hub.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:45.910" end="00:20:50.500">Third great surprise that we had was at microsoft embrace the notion of what you need to do to</p>
      <p begin="00:20:50.500" end="00:20:55.190">make multi container apps work and embrace the notion if you want to make multi container</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55.190" end="00:20:59.930">actually portable you have to be open about how you do orchestration as well so</p>
      <p begin="00:20:59.930" end="00:21:04.920">were so thrilled that microsoft has embraced dockers open orchestration initiatives compose machine</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04.920" end="00:21:13.000">it's warm fourth-grade surprising yes, there's more combine those three things.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:13.000" end="00:21:14.160">You're not only going to be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14.160" end="00:21:18.510">make great multi container windows applications are great multi container windows</p>
      <p begin="00:21:18.510" end="00:21:23.940">applications you'll be able to mix and match windows containers and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.940" end="00:21:28.040">...containers which means you'll be able to use ...linux back-end and windows front-end</p>
      <p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:32.090">or vice versa basically choose the best damn tools for the best damn application</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:35.480">that you want to build and run it on any server.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:39.360">And, the fifth and perhaps greater surprise we've had working with microsoft is ...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:43.170">...happen quickly and everything that I've spoken about is either live</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43.170" end="00:21:48.050">or working well in the lab right now so without further ado I'd like to bring a microsoft which city of</p>
      <p begin="00:21:48.050" end="00:21:52.910">...on board to show you what happens when you combine these great platforms together again</p>

      <p begin="00:22:04.380" end="00:22:08.430">...dot net five application fabric cameras and e-commerce site</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.430" end="00:22:10.780">...of a standard ...I'm going to be doing some dev test</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.780" end="00:22:15.590">on the first thing I'd like to do is to deploy it to a doctor container running ...</p>
      <p begin="00:22:15.590" end="00:22:21.370">windows server machine on this step test box I've got a virtual machines running windows server with doctor support</p>
      <p begin="00:22:21.370" end="00:22:26.310">doctor container support and I'm going to take a look at the containers that I've already got running in</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.310" end="00:22:29.660">a virtual machine ...executing the darker ps command which</p>
      <p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:32.350">lists the active containers you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:36.750">I've got two containers active one is a mine crafts server and the other one is no,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:36.750" end="00:22:38.720">JS application which shows that</p>
      <p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:44.080">doctor containers on windows support many different run times in languages that you might be using.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:48.910">Now what I'm going to do is package up the fabric cam applications that I can also deployed into container and I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:22:48.910" end="00:22:53.210">going to use a several doctor commands here one called doctor build which</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:58.190">we'll package it up ...the image that's produced with the name fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:22:58.190" end="00:22:59.590">camp so it's easy to remember.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:03.950">And, then go ahead and package that ...going to be executing a series of steps</p>
      <p begin="00:23:03.950" end="00:23:08.000">which take that ASP dot net five application package it up in a</p>
      <p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.320">...to image and the next step.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:13.770">Is to run that container with that image</p>
      <p begin="00:23:13.770" end="00:23:18.510">so I'll type darker run dash IT to make it interactive you'll see</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.510" end="00:23:23.080">why I'm doing this in a second and?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.080" end="00:23:25.410">Forget the documents darker.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:25.410" end="00:23:29.560">Run and fabric ...</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.560" end="00:23:31.580">Now the reason that I've had it be</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.580" end="00:23:36.100">...so that we can print-out the IP address so I can see the IP address of the website that's</p>
      <p begin="00:23:36.100" end="00:23:39.540">going to launch that fabric an application if I go back and</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.540" end="00:23:44.020">do a darker ps at this point you'll see that fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44.020" end="00:23:48.020">came image has been launched into a container here now one of the really fun parts</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48.020" end="00:23:52.980">about using the doctor client is that if you don't specify name for your container it comes up with</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.980" end="00:23:59.190">a random one so let's go see what names ...come up with it called this one tender</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.190" end="00:24:06.030">and look at that but that's what are the odds of that coming up like that?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:10.250">So, let's take a look at that website now which is going to be active launch</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.250" end="00:24:15.030">IEEE the IP addresses ten fifty dot zero ...one twenty two and we're hitting tend</p>
      <p begin="00:24:15.030" end="00:24:16.960">...fifty.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.190">That one zero two and then we go net running</p>
      <p begin="00:24:20.190" end="00:24:26.300">...windows server container executed with darker but I'm showing you a lot of</p>
      <p begin="00:24:26.300" end="00:24:33.690">technologies ...might not be familiar with so just a quick raising and how many people have heard of linux?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.690" end="00:24:38.330">Okay, for those people and they're watching a lot about a third of the audience raise your hands.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.330" end="00:24:41.170">I'm just getting everybody raise their hand of course.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.170" end="00:24:46.200">But, what I'm ...to show you is scott mention that we've got dot net support on linux and we</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:49.760">integrate it with doctor containers as well so here I've got the</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:55.690">same exact application and this time I'm going to sh into a</p>
      <p begin="00:24:55.690" end="00:25:00.000">linux virtual machine and run the doctor ps ...can see I've got no containers running</p>
      <p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:04.850">in that virtual machine instead of using darker run to ...right</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:07.560">...visual studio using the public command?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.580" end="00:25:10.770">Right here I've configured to launch</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.770" end="00:25:15.970">to that darker host here's the IP address that host when I type publish press</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.970" end="00:25:20.570">publish here it's going to package it up and execute the same doctor klein commands</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.570" end="00:25:25.370">to deploy that fabric came application on to linux if I go back and type</p>
      <p begin="00:25:25.370" end="00:25:29.190">doctor ps again you'll see there's fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29.190" end="00:25:33.990">can latest and there's the name prickly was knack always fun to look at the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:33.990" end="00:25:38.510">...of the doctors ...creates.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:38.510" end="00:25:43.370">Let's go see if that websites come up and sure enough there it is and you can see that that's</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43.370" end="00:25:46.790">the same IP addresses this h command so I'm looking at the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.790" end="00:25:49.650">darker container running on that virtual machine.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:49.650" end="00:25:51.770">But, now there's more I'm doing ...test of this fabric</p>
      <p begin="00:25:51.770" end="00:25:54.970">...application and I'd like to continue to use</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54.970" end="00:25:59.820">visual studio to do that and I can now with integration of container debugging</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59.820" end="00:26:04.050">into visual studio somebody got a server explore got a virtual machines there's</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.050" end="00:26:11.760">the doctor VM and there's a prickly was knack container I attach the butter.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:16.700">just as a normal visual studio debugging experience I've got the libraries loaded here and you can</p>

      <p begin="00:26:24.710" end="00:26:29.730">And, I want to sort of break point here on the function that I'm debugging I go back</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.730" end="00:26:34.070">to the website it refresh and I'm at the break point debugging.</p>

      <p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:18.340">a really amazing experience for people making mobile applications on any platform let's switch over</p>
      <p begin="00:34:18.340" end="00:34:24.110">to visual studio online and see our managing this code now in this</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.110" end="00:34:27.880">case our team is working on it get repository that's running in</p>

      <p begin="00:34:46.150" end="00:34:50.950">to me is that workflow that the team is going through we've got the</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.950" end="00:34:56.010">...running in visual studio online as well so this ASP dot net five net course</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56.010" end="00:35:01.550">...is building in via and then deploying out to the applications</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.550" end="00:35:02.340">and as rapture</p>
      <p begin="00:35:02.340" end="00:35:07.840">this automatically now if I switch over to measure I can see</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.840" end="00:35:12.360">that application in the API host here and when I move</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.360" end="00:35:16.460">that into production we can click within as your itself and see the deployments</p>
      <p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:21.440">here as well so I can see a deployment that john put out on sunday</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:25.910">click on that and that integration with visual studio online I can see his</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25.910" end="00:35:30.810">commits whether that build succeeded so I check into get visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.810" end="00:35:35.160">online it runs the build runs the test make sure that everything is okay sends it</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35.160" end="00:35:39.950">out into asher once it's in a measure in production I can also scale</p>
      <p begin="00:35:39.950" end="00:35:44.640">it can automatically scale it coming here and scale by I can set the</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:49.060">number of instances and a target range of the sheep views of the cpu goes above</p>
      <p begin="00:35:49.060" end="00:35:52.640">a certain amount the application will scale so I get the full</p>

      <p begin="00:35:55.830" end="00:36:01.250">production and now this application in production scaling I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:36:01.250" end="00:36:05.840">get insights into what's going on and you would expect to have great web insights</p>
      <p begin="00:36:05.840" end="00:36:10.260">we've got application insight showing is all sorts of details we have dependency</p>
      <p begin="00:36:10.260" end="00:36:15.070">tracking all the way down to a single line of code so from visual studio and as</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15.070" end="00:36:19.740">you've got the best dev ops that allow teams to create both web and mobile</p>
      <p begin="00:36:19.740" end="00:36:24.850">laps with our recent integration of hockey app I've got the same deep</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.850" end="00:36:28.530">insights for mobile applications so inside integrated into</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.530" end="00:36:33.210">manager you can see here the mobile app crashes events</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.210" end="00:36:37.880">sessions by country I can go all the way down to a single line of code and here's actually the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:37.880" end="00:36:42.250">...version of this application and I can go and see specifically what</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.250" end="00:36:47.030">worked what didn't down to an exact line in this case of swift code</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.030" end="00:36:49.760">such as three hundred sixty degree view</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:54.210">of any platform from the highest level all the way down to the</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:58.720">lowest-level to a single line of code so this is a lot to take</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:01.980">...let's step back for a second and get an understanding about how this fits</p>
      <p begin="00:37:01.980" end="00:37:05.840">...we've got web apps we've got mobile applications</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.840" end="00:37:10.700">those are talking to API and the back-end when I submitted my order</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10.700" end="00:37:13.910">it went to this order API written ...net ...</p>
      <p begin="00:37:15.360" end="00:37:20.160">Those API asking be written by me or they can be written by third-party or brought in</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.700">from our marketplace but a really interesting thing is this concept of logic</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24.700" end="00:37:29.350">applications because there's business processes like when that order gets completed I want to get</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.350" end="00:37:41.650">notified as a customer about that so let's take a look at what a logic application.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.650" end="00:37:45.990">Let me switch over here we go so this is an application here where</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.990" end="00:37:50.300">we've got individual API apps the sequel connector is going</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.300" end="00:37:55.130">to be looking at the data for the orders and then it flows through this work</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.130" end="00:37:59.800">flow from one API up to another using a technology called swagger where that</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.800" end="00:38:04.420">meta data is going to the system into sales force and then in this case</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:08.430">we're posting a message to slack I can bring in that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.430" end="00:38:13.280">order API that we created an asp dot net and then get the details</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:18.220">for that order you see that actually got populated using that swagger details and</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:23.090">then it knows about previous things within this ...this</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.090" end="00:38:28.400">is a reliable durable workflow in the cloud and now I can click on truly</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:31.880">oil and bringing that's really a connector and then send a message</p>
      <p begin="00:38:31.880" end="00:38:35.800">to let-me know when this when this order is completed.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36.860" end="00:38:41.030">So, here I can access any aspects of what ...flowing</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41.030" end="00:38:45.680">through the system in this case I'll look at the phone number</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:52.480">and we will have the from number VTwo number.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:58.560">And, then under text here we're going to have.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:01.820">Hi, person sales force first name your order</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.820" end="00:39:06.570">is reading this is the kind of common business process that you don't necessarily want to write</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.570" end="00:39:11.120">...because it changes a lot and this is all happening in the cloud</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.120" end="00:39:13.800">in this business orchestration service called logic</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.800" end="00:39:16.880">apps and you can integrate this with any</p>

      <p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:31.720">I think this is pretty amazing but I feel like perhaps I haven't sufficiently</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.720" end="00:39:36.730">blow your mind and I promised a number of people that I would do that so let's take a moment and then</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36.730" end="00:39:39.080">switch over to our</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.080" end="00:39:43.510">macintosh here now on this mac you can see that I can load up visual studio</p>
      <p begin="00:39:43.510" end="00:39:47.920">online I can manage my code and write my cross platform dot</p>

      <p begin="00:41:24.010" end="00:41:27.430">And, gifts and I can push it visual studio online</p>
      <p begin="00:41:27.430" end="00:41:32.370">...where will then run through the process be built tested deployed and scaled</p>

      <p begin="01:10:32.410" end="01:10:37.320">It's a set of complex algorithms that will fundamentally change the way you and I</p>

      <p begin="01:10:42.140" end="01:10:47.110">to give you some context let me tell you a little bit about our company first where based in the UK and</p>
      <p begin="01:10:47.110" end="01:10:52.040">...the largest social given platform to enable people to raise money and</p>
      <p begin="01:10:52.040" end="01:10:57.800">do amazing things for the causes and for the charities that they care about some people decide</p>
      <p begin="01:10:57.800" end="01:11:02.040">to do the marathon obviously recently people were throwing buckets of cold water on top of</p>
      <p begin="01:11:02.040" end="01:11:07.020">the head all in the name of charity and we've been fortunate in having around twenty</p>
      <p begin="01:11:07.020" end="01:11:11.820">three million people from over a hundred and sixty countries in the world?</p>
      <p begin="01:11:11.820" end="01:11:15.530">Do this and they've raised in excess of three billion dollars</p>
      <p begin="01:11:15.530" end="01:11:21.580">for charity and for good causes and this is taken us a lot closer to our goal which is to</p>
      <p begin="01:11:21.580" end="01:11:27.490">ensure that every great corps gets the funding that it requires now we live in a</p>

      <p begin="01:11:32.120" end="01:11:35.010">An if everyone did that we would eradicate poverty.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:36.120" end="01:11:39.030">We would put cancer out of business now</p>
      <p begin="01:11:39.030" end="01:11:43.820">...team had the task of trying to understand why that isn't happening using analytics</p>
      <p begin="01:11:43.820" end="01:11:48.790">using machine learning and getting a real understanding as to how we think and how we make that decision</p>
      <p begin="01:11:48.790" end="01:11:54.160">to give and our analytics has identified three key things that are product</p>
      <p begin="01:11:54.160" end="01:11:58.580">needed to use data for the first is that it needed to change giving from being</p>
      <p begin="01:11:58.580" end="01:12:03.290">a transactional activity to something that's far more engaging it also</p>
      <p begin="01:12:03.290" end="01:12:07.770">need to be personal of course it needed to be social after all we</p>
      <p begin="01:12:07.770" end="01:12:11.620">sold some of the biggest problems as human species by connecting with each</p>
      <p begin="01:12:11.620" end="01:12:17.000">other and collaborating but at the heart of all of this is that we needed to</p>
      <p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:20.700">make giving personal which for us means we need to understand what</p>
      <p begin="01:12:20.700" end="01:12:25.630">you specifically care about traditional ways of trying to address personalization we</p>
      <p begin="01:12:25.630" end="01:12:27.160">would use things like look-alikes</p>
      <p begin="01:12:27.160" end="01:12:31.920">or collaborative filtering but in this space that doesn't work what you care about</p>
      <p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:37.640">...specific to you if you care about cancer or beating cancer I can't</p>
      <p begin="01:12:37.640" end="01:12:42.600">find somebody who looks like you and say that they also care about cancer everybody</p>
      <p begin="01:12:42.600" end="01:12:47.390">has something specific that they care about however using machine learning and</p>
      <p begin="01:12:47.390" end="01:12:52.350">graph theory on this platform we've managed to crack that problem</p>
      <p begin="01:12:52.350" end="01:12:56.890">in fact what we've done is we've built a machine does that those three specific</p>
      <p begin="01:12:56.890" end="01:13:01.570">things first of all it understands how you specifically want to give</p>
      <p begin="01:13:01.570" end="01:13:06.430">giving isn't just about money it understands whether you want to give time or</p>
      <p begin="01:13:06.430" end="01:13:10.350">whether you want to give effort secondly the algorithm can</p>
      <p begin="01:13:10.350" end="01:13:15.310">work out specifically what you care about and it also understands that what you</p>
      <p begin="01:13:15.310" end="01:13:20.290">care about changes it's a moving database it's not static it ...</p>
      <p begin="01:13:20.290" end="01:13:25.180">as your circumstances change as your associations change and the more interactive you</p>
      <p begin="01:13:25.180" end="01:13:31.070">become and, lastly my most favorite part of the algorithm is that it understands how</p>
      <p begin="01:13:31.070" end="01:13:36.420">to interact with you specifically with you to make giving more engaging and remove</p>
      <p begin="01:13:36.420" end="01:13:41.020">those barriers that might exist to stop you from giving now we couldn't have done</p>
      <p begin="01:13:41.020" end="01:13:46.020">is without the as your platform where small team of scientists and engineers</p>
      <p begin="01:13:46.020" end="01:13:50.480">and what is your platform really allowed us to do was focus intensely on our</p>
      <p begin="01:13:50.480" end="01:13:55.470">goal we don't have a team of operations experts ...can managing huge cluster of ...</p>
      <p begin="01:13:55.470" end="01:14:00.770">...cloud machines in the cloud but this platform was ideal for us and these are the</p>
      <p begin="01:14:00.770" end="01:14:05.550">components that we used and this is how we architect them essentially had</p>
      <p begin="01:14:05.550" end="01:14:10.130">three core processes we had a batch process which runs nightly a real-time</p>

      <p begin="01:14:14.930" end="01:14:18.090">And, the ...process is the backbone</p>
      <p begin="01:14:18.090" end="01:14:23.750">for everything that we do and at the center of it is HD insight this is where we do all of</p>
      <p begin="01:14:23.750" end="01:14:27.520">our large calculations this is where we build that give graph that I</p>
      <p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:32.500">showed you earlier so essentially we take all of our data we uploaded into blob storage</p>

      <p begin="01:14:55.910" end="01:15:00.040">...or the issue of web app which is where we</p>
      <p begin="01:15:00.040" end="01:15:04.780">put our API and where the product has access to it and all of this</p>
      <p begin="01:15:04.780" end="01:15:09.350">manifests itself on the product itself this is what our feed looks like this is what</p>
      <p begin="01:15:09.350" end="01:15:13.460">...platforms our and what's exciting is that this is where we</p>
      <p begin="01:15:13.460" end="01:15:18.720">are seeing giving move from a transactional activity to more engaging we're seeing</p>
      <p begin="01:15:18.720" end="01:15:23.400">people be far more interactive informal social connecting collaborating</p>

      <p begin="01:15:31.940" end="01:15:36.660">of an impact this is going to have ...really in a fantastic position because</p>
      <p begin="01:15:36.660" end="01:15:41.540">this platform has allowed us to focus exclusively on our goal to</p>

      <p begin="01:16:20.010" end="01:16:24.510">All right we'll move to the next chapter of our platform</p>
      <p begin="01:16:24.510" end="01:16:29.520">innovation office there are three core concepts.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:30.650" end="01:16:34.260">In the transformation of office ...a platform.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:34.260" end="01:16:37.150">The first one is about the user experience.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:38.510" end="01:16:42.710">We're opening up the office user experience for all</p>
      <p begin="01:16:42.710" end="01:16:46.170">of your applications in fundamental ways so that</p>
      <p begin="01:16:46.170" end="01:16:49.860">your applications can show up in the context of what</p>
      <p begin="01:16:49.860" end="01:16:55.070">...plus users of office due in office create staff</p>
      <p begin="01:16:55.070" end="01:16:59.870">do get stuff done collaborate communicate we want you to be able</p>
      <p begin="01:16:59.870" end="01:17:03.610">to build applications that fit naturally into those context.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:04.690" end="01:17:07.510">Second we want to go beyond.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:07.510" end="01:17:11.830">Single applications very API in data silos</p>
      <p begin="01:17:11.830" end="01:17:16.120">to us semantically rich graph of data that is available</p>
      <p begin="01:17:16.120" end="01:17:22.670">for you to be able to consume as well as extent.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:22.670" end="01:17:24.070">And, third.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:24.070" end="01:17:28.810">We want to have the capability to reason over that rich</p>
      <p begin="01:17:28.810" end="01:17:33.660">graph and add intelligence into your applications so that not only does</p>
      <p begin="01:17:33.660" end="01:17:36.830">it drive new features or more importantly</p>
      <p begin="01:17:36.830" end="01:17:41.370">...engagement in your applications so those are the tree</p>
      <p begin="01:17:41.370" end="01:17:46.340">concept that fundamentally change office so we want to give you a quick tour of that</p>
      <p begin="01:17:46.340" end="01:17:51.340">so that you can look at what your applications can do to exploit these capabilities and I</p>
      <p begin="01:17:51.340" end="01:17:59.600">and for that I just want to introduce rob ...from our office team to show you some of those hi rob.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:04.550">So, how can we get started by talking about how we ...moving from office</p>

      <p begin="01:22:33.670" end="01:22:37.890">applications that you bill sharp throughout office they extend beyond</p>
      <p begin="01:22:37.890" end="01:22:43.230">any single application now let's talk a little bit about this graph how are we</p>
      <p begin="01:22:43.230" end="01:22:46.800">building ...graph and exposing the graph to developers,</p>
      <p begin="01:22:46.800" end="01:22:51.720">yeah, that's actually pop it open and take a look at exactly what it looks like so this week</p>
      <p begin="01:22:51.720" end="01:22:55.710">...build we're announcing a preview of the unify eighty</p>
      <p begin="01:22:55.710" end="01:23:00.140">...point for office three sixty five API this builds on top of the</p>
      <p begin="01:23:00.140" end="01:23:05.100">...calendar workloads that we delivered last fall and what it does is make it easy for</p>
      <p begin="01:23:05.100" end="01:23:10.410">developers to get to this data in a unify consistent way so we just popping open a</p>
      <p begin="01:23:10.410" end="01:23:14.400">little API explorer tool that can show us what are some of those request</p>
      <p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:19.100">...response patterns look like so what we use a developer have to do in order to get access to</p>
      <p begin="01:23:19.100" end="01:23:22.690">this rich data what you can see is the URL a pretty simple</p>
      <p begin="01:23:22.690" end="01:23:27.190">...microsoft-dot-com version number and the tenant that I'm connecting to</p>
      <p begin="01:23:27.190" end="01:23:32.020">so make it easy for me in this example the query active directory together list</p>
      <p begin="01:23:32.020" end="01:23:36.910">of users I'm karen from users for a particular departments in this case operations and what I</p>
      <p begin="01:23:36.910" end="01:23:41.740">get back is exactly what you would expect clean well formatted easy-to-understand</p>
      <p begin="01:23:41.740" end="01:23:46.470">...son every developer in the room has a whole tool kit that can parse this and use it to</p>
      <p begin="01:23:46.470" end="01:23:51.580">build great solutions but the point is that this is actually a graph so I can go from an</p>
      <p begin="01:23:51.580" end="01:23:57.090">individual user to drill into their files all I have to do to get to the files from one</p>
      <p begin="01:23:57.090" end="01:24:01.320">drive for business is sticks slash files on the end of the URL and from ...</p>
      <p begin="01:24:01.320" end="01:24:06.300">I see data documents coming back from one drive these are just the files that the</p>
      <p begin="01:24:06.300" end="01:24:10.860">logging user's permission ...that's the powerful concept which is you no longer are going</p>
      <p begin="01:24:10.860" end="01:24:15.800">to different applications for different data you're not going to active directory for users and groups and then</p>
      <p begin="01:24:15.800" end="01:24:19.910">to one drive for files but you're able to traverse the entirety of the graph</p>
      <p begin="01:24:19.910" end="01:24:22.540">with these API exactly right in fact</p>
      <p begin="01:24:22.540" end="01:24:27.220">speaking of groups let's pull up another example office three sixty five has a new concept</p>
      <p begin="01:24:27.220" end="01:24:31.530">for unify modern group that brings together the people and the documents</p>
      <p begin="01:24:31.530" end="01:24:35.770">and conversations encounter that they're having and we're exposing that through the unify ...</p>
      <p begin="01:24:35.770" end="01:24:40.750">...so I can query the active directory for groups that I can navigate through them</p>
      <p begin="01:24:40.750" end="01:24:44.870">defines ...files that belong to those groups so here we actually see stick on</p>
      <p begin="01:24:44.870" end="01:24:49.580">a slash files and it brings up the files associate with that group again trims to the</p>
      <p begin="01:24:49.580" end="01:24:54.600">...user now this notion of logging user is a really common pattern for</p>
      <p begin="01:24:54.600" end="01:24:59.670">people building solutions so we've actually made it super easy there's a me token that you can stick in your</p>
      <p begin="01:24:59.670" end="01:25:04.550">URL to just get back the data for the ...use and that's probably very important because everything here</p>
      <p begin="01:25:04.550" end="01:25:09.400">...the policies and ...that you put into a D so in some sense the</p>
      <p begin="01:25:09.400" end="01:25:14.340">...token gives you access for the user using the applications credentials exactly</p>
      <p begin="01:25:14.340" end="01:25:18.990">right and because now I have access to my information I can go and look at my</p>
      <p begin="01:25:18.990" end="01:25:23.620">calendar just slash events on the end of the URL and that brings back appointments that are alive</p>
      <p begin="01:25:23.620" end="01:25:28.460">and my outlook calendar and ...idea to get to messages last messages and boom</p>
      <p begin="01:25:28.460" end="01:25:33.200">I'm in my inbox coming from exchange and it's just that easy awesome so</p>
      <p begin="01:25:33.200" end="01:25:36.290">how can we talk about the last concept which is how do we go</p>
      <p begin="01:25:36.290" end="01:25:41.080">from here to really building the richness</p>
      <p begin="01:25:41.080" end="01:25:45.720">of intelligence inside of your applications sure so,</p>
      <p begin="01:25:45.720" end="01:25:50.190">this is powered by the office graphs and the thing about the office graph is we talked about</p>
      <p begin="01:25:50.190" end="01:25:55.170">data we talked about ...ends and we really talked about how we can use that to drive a whole</p>
      <p begin="01:25:55.170" end="01:25:59.390">other set of insights we know who are the people that conversations the meeting</p>
      <p begin="01:25:59.390" end="01:26:02.910">in the organizations and what we can do with that is provide additional insights</p>
      <p begin="01:26:02.910" end="01:26:07.310">...they can use that in the preview here to query the graph to get information out</p>
      <p begin="01:26:07.310" end="01:26:12.070">...in addition we're delivering a first party app in the shape of delved that actually</p>
      <p begin="01:26:12.070" end="01:26:16.740">provides me every day with information about what am I working on it helps me search</p>
      <p begin="01:26:16.740" end="01:26:23.800">and discover the contents that my colleagues are using?</p>
      <p begin="01:26:23.800" end="01:26:27.850">There's something funny going on.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:27.850" end="01:26:30.950">Keep going ...</p>
      <p begin="01:26:30.950" end="01:26:34.130">Ok, so, here I am looking at dell and,</p>
      <p begin="01:26:34.130" end="01:26:39.180">what I see is exactly what you'd expect some cards and contact that ...help me stay</p>
      <p begin="01:26:39.180" end="01:26:44.090">up-to-date ...my colleagues are doing so I see an excel notebook that is coming out</p>
      <p begin="01:26:44.090" end="01:26:49.080">...one drive the let's me see here's what my boss built here some cape gis here's an attachment</p>
      <p begin="01:26:49.080" end="01:26:53.980">that lives in email but we've been working with partners to imagine what will it look</p>
      <p begin="01:26:53.980" end="01:26:58.850">like when we have additional third-party signals coming to the graph how can they get into this</p>
      <p begin="01:26:58.850" end="01:27:03.350">notification stream what we see ...opportunities so that's a card from</p>
      <p begin="01:27:03.350" end="01:27:08.630">...force and that's exactly right this is a carbon sales were showing the ...showing information about</p>
      <p begin="01:27:08.630" end="01:27:13.900">...account etc I can navigate down here's information coming from twitter and</p>
      <p begin="01:27:13.900" end="01:27:15.930">believe that we see information coming from</p>
      <p begin="01:27:15.930" end="01:27:20.550">...people are collaborating boards I can navigate directly through and get to that</p>
      <p begin="01:27:20.550" end="01:27:24.750">and, let's actually scroll down a little bit further and what we see is a purchase order coming</p>
      <p begin="01:27:24.750" end="01:27:28.140">from dynamics AX that looks like a super important one so it was great</p>
      <p begin="01:27:28.140" end="01:27:33.060">...made it easy for me to take action on it right so this is no longer now information that is</p>
      <p begin="01:27:33.060" end="01:27:37.960">inside of the office graph that's based on the data of our apps but people</p>
      <p begin="01:27:37.960" end="01:27:42.420">are able to extend the graph with additional edges and nodes that's</p>
      <p begin="01:27:42.420" end="01:27:54.060">all surfacing in doubt that's exactly right wonderful thank you so much ...by much?</p>

      <p begin="02:01:32.410" end="02:01:37.060">tons of other developers to build great compelling apps and what I'm here to do</p>
      <p begin="02:01:37.060" end="02:01:41.040">as terry said is to talk about how we're going to enhance the windows</p>
      <p begin="02:01:41.040" end="02:01:45.720">user experience so that end-users on lots and lots of devices but</p>
      <p begin="02:01:45.720" end="02:01:49.520">in particular I'm going to focus on the pc how end-users</p>
      <p begin="02:01:49.520" end="02:01:53.820">will be able to discover and engage with all of the apps that</p>
      <p begin="02:01:53.820" end="02:01:58.740">you and we right we know that great technology for building apps is just</p>
      <p begin="02:01:58.740" end="02:02:03.410">part of the story you need users to engage with them so I want to show you some of the work we're doing that's going to</p>
      <p begin="02:02:03.410" end="02:02:08.240">make that possible ...I'm going to wrap up with one more cool demo of how the universal</p>
      <p begin="02:02:08.240" end="02:02:13.220">windows platform enables new devices and new kinds of actions on devices</p>
      <p begin="02:02:13.220" end="02:02:19.740">so let me just jump right in and get started so, I have here a very recent build</p>
      <p begin="02:02:19.740" end="02:02:23.830">of windows ten for the pc and I'm going to begin on the start menu I want to</p>
      <p begin="02:02:23.830" end="02:02:28.280">show you some of the work we've been doing to continue to tweak the design</p>
      <p begin="02:02:28.280" end="02:02:32.670">and improve the visuals in the interaction so you'll see</p>
      <p begin="02:02:32.670" end="02:02:36.430">what I've got here we think is pretty close to what we expect to have</p>
      <p begin="02:02:36.430" end="02:02:41.040">one we're done although of course we're going to continue to take feedback from our insiders you'll</p>
      <p begin="02:02:41.040" end="02:02:45.150">notice there's new beautiful live tile animations that</p>
      <p begin="02:02:45.150" end="02:02:50.140">helped draw people's attention to the apps and the app data for the things that they've</p>
      <p begin="02:02:50.140" end="02:02:53.800">pinned you'll notice we've clean the layout up a bit for those</p>
      <p begin="02:02:53.800" end="02:02:58.000">of you insiders who kind of surprised us with your enthusiasm</p>
      <p begin="02:02:58.000" end="02:03:03.130">for windows seven aero glass you'll notice the translucent see here's the blur</p>
      <p begin="02:03:03.130" end="02:03:07.350">effect that you start windows seven so we're trying to bring some of that field back</p>

      <p begin="02:03:11.820" end="02:03:16.630">laps at the bottom were bringing jump lists back in so you can see here's file explore with</p>
      <p begin="02:03:16.630" end="02:03:21.090">jump ...and this work for other apps as well thank you?</p>
      <p begin="02:03:21.090" end="02:03:23.100">But, the thing I ...sort of focus on a little bit</p>
      <p begin="02:03:23.100" end="02:03:27.470">is this space right here where in this case I have an installed ...out for a</p>
      <p begin="02:03:27.470" end="02:03:32.380">little while so the system is going to give us a smart suggestion for</p>
      <p begin="02:03:32.380" end="02:03:37.150">an app in the store that is going to be one that's suitable for me as I'm using</p>
      <p begin="02:03:37.150" end="02:03:41.830">my pc on the client we know which apps are launching ...which apps you're installing</p>
      <p begin="02:03:41.830" end="02:03:46.590">so we're able to communicate with the store and bring down suggestions that are personalize for</p>
      <p begin="02:03:46.590" end="02:03:51.550">you to help users learn about great new apps that are available for them to trout</p>
      <p begin="02:03:51.550" end="02:03:54.300">and their pc and as time goes by we</p>
      <p begin="02:03:54.300" end="02:03:58.460">reuse that space in a smart way to help script the</p>
      <p begin="02:03:58.460" end="02:04:01.310">...discovery of apps first but then</p>
      <p begin="02:04:01.310" end="02:04:03.670">their engagement later so five installed</p>
      <p begin="02:04:03.670" end="02:04:08.620">an app as you see here for a little while that space becomes the recently installed</p>
      <p begin="02:04:08.620" end="02:04:13.410">out the user confine the app they can revisit and if they use it enough it'll move</p>
      <p begin="02:04:13.410" end="02:04:16.960">its way up into the most used section automatically and of course at</p>
      <p begin="02:04:16.960" end="02:04:21.890">any time the user can drag from left to right to take any of those apps and pin them as</p>
      <p begin="02:04:21.890" end="02:04:26.750">full live tiles so think of this as the users lifecycle of discovery</p>
      <p begin="02:04:26.750" end="02:04:32.650">and engagement and re-use which ...trying to script right into the start menu?</p>
      <p begin="02:04:32.650" end="02:04:36.600">There's a whole other area that users are engaging with where we want to</p>
      <p begin="02:04:36.600" end="02:04:41.210">bring some beauty and new ideas for how they can get value out of</p>

      <p begin="02:10:19.030" end="02:10:24.510">windows phone before so I want to show you the range of sorts of things that are possible I</p>
      <p begin="02:10:24.510" end="02:10:28.950">want to imagine in one case I want to bring up the app to do a task with the app and</p>
      <p begin="02:10:28.950" end="02:10:32.420">the other case I simply want court trying to get something done for me</p>
      <p begin="02:10:32.420" end="02:10:37.880">using the technology that's part of an app so here's a couple of examples hey courts</p>

      <p begin="02:10:44.710" end="02:10:49.060">Starting to chat with terry myers and now in this case I gave a</p>

      <p begin="02:10:58.110" end="02:11:02.840">context with the previous chatting we were doing like keep going with my chat so that's sort of a deep</p>
      <p begin="02:11:02.840" end="02:11:05.710">...launching kind of task but</p>
      <p begin="02:11:05.710" end="02:11:10.620">there's a whole class of tasks where we want courts honor to represent being</p>
      <p begin="02:11:10.620" end="02:11:15.290">personal assistant that can get things done for you even using the</p>
      <p begin="02:11:15.290" end="02:11:20.070">capabilities that are written into the apps that are part of the windows ecosystem so I can ask for</p>

      <p begin="02:11:25.710" end="02:11:28.240">hey core tunnel will tell terry</p>

      <p begin="02:11:50.510" end="02:11:53.990">get the idea here now in this case ...asked court</p>
      <p begin="02:11:53.990" end="02:11:58.850">...to do something using an app and in that case the app you I didn't need to get displayed so</p>
      <p begin="02:11:58.850" end="02:12:03.580">core thomas canvas was able to do the disambiguation if I want to I could go right here</p>
      <p begin="02:12:03.580" end="02:12:06.490">...click the link to open the app but that's not what I need to do there's</p>
      <p begin="02:12:06.490" end="02:12:12.100">court on helping me get stuff done okay so I've talked about the lock screen</p>
      <p begin="02:12:12.100" end="02:12:16.090">...start screen court time there's one other really big feature in windows ten that has</p>
      <p begin="02:12:16.090" end="02:12:19.360">relevance this conversation to all of us developers and that is</p>
      <p begin="02:12:19.360" end="02:12:23.460">...project spartan project spartan products part,</p>
      <p begin="02:12:23.460" end="02:12:27.790">you know, I have to admit are pr team has been giving me and</p>
      <p begin="02:12:27.790" end="02:12:32.640">us a hard time because they say it's not a great idea to keep saying project spartan when that's not</p>
      <p begin="02:12:32.640" end="02:12:37.120">really the name of the web would you like to hear the name of the new web browser in windows</p>
      <p begin="02:12:37.120" end="02:12:57.650">...ok let's run on.</p>
      <p begin="02:13:55.930" end="02:14:00.460">Microsoft edge is the browser built for windows</p>
      <p begin="02:14:00.460" end="02:14:04.830">ten ...be available on the widest range of windows ten devices and for us</p>
      <p begin="02:14:04.830" end="02:14:09.300">the name refers to the idea of being on the edge of consuming</p>
      <p begin="02:14:09.300" end="02:14:14.100">and creating it refers to the developer notion of being closest to the modern</p>
      <p begin="02:14:14.100" end="02:14:19.480">capabilities of the web so, it is a browser that end-users will think about</p>
      <p begin="02:14:19.480" end="02:14:24.370">forgetting things done for things like note-taking on the internet for a great</p>
      <p begin="02:14:24.370" end="02:14:29.090">way of reading and consuming content and it's a browser that has core</p>
      <p begin="02:14:29.090" end="02:14:34.870">...built in so it learns the things that you care about and helps you get things done I'm not going to</p>
      <p begin="02:14:34.870" end="02:14:39.420">go show any of that stuff we've shown that before as developers ...few reasons that you're going</p>
      <p begin="02:14:39.420" end="02:14:44.010">to care about microsoft edge you're going to care about the blazing fast core technology</p>
      <p begin="02:14:44.010" end="02:14:49.000">that's inside it you'll hear more about that in a talk tomorrow you're going to care that we're writing it as</p>
      <p begin="02:14:49.000" end="02:14:53.700">a universal windows app proving out the platform and you're also going to care because we're going</p>
      <p begin="02:14:53.700" end="02:14:58.100">to make it helped users discover and engage with your apps and</p>
      <p begin="02:14:58.100" end="02:15:02.240">your sites so they come over here ...show you some of what we're doing there are</p>
      <p begin="02:15:02.240" end="02:15:07.240">come down here to the economy the task bar which now has a completely different</p>
      <p begin="02:15:07.240" end="02:15:12.130">and better meeting that it has for a while and open up microsoft edge</p>
      <p begin="02:15:12.130" end="02:15:16.610">now the first thing that I want to show you that's new is the new tab page they</p>
      <p begin="02:15:16.610" end="02:15:21.370">were adding to microsoft at today in IEEE the task of starting a new tab and starting</p>
      <p begin="02:15:21.370" end="02:15:26.350">new web browsing happens over a billion times a day so this is a heavily used piece of</p>
      <p begin="02:15:26.350" end="02:15:30.710">URI and you'll see here how we're going to take advantage of core</p>
      <p begin="02:15:30.710" end="02:15:35.650">thomas presence in the browser and understanding of you along with an understanding of</p>
      <p begin="02:15:35.650" end="02:15:39.750">value ...the ecosystem to give users a great way to start their</p>

      <p begin="02:15:47.460" end="02:15:51.520">and in some cases there's an app available for these sites in the store we make that</p>
      <p begin="02:15:51.520" end="02:15:54.350">...available as I scroll down you'll see</p>
      <p begin="02:15:54.350" end="02:15:58.780">here's some featured apps that were showing here's a lot of news stories that are relevant</p>
      <p begin="02:15:58.780" end="02:16:03.730">to me in fact my sports favorites that you saw in court sauna and mike stock watch list in</p>
      <p begin="02:16:03.730" end="02:16:07.950">court on those are represented right here in the new tap page that's an example of course</p>
      <p begin="02:16:07.950" end="02:16:12.290">...helping to compose this in a way that's useful to me so</p>
      <p begin="02:16:12.290" end="02:16:15.860">that's new tab and we've been testing this a ton and</p>
      <p begin="02:16:15.860" end="02:16:20.760">we're optimistic about its opportunity to help people discover and connect with work</p>

      <p begin="02:16:25.030" end="02:16:29.330">doing and microsoft edge that's has huge relevance to you and that</p>
      <p begin="02:16:29.330" end="02:16:33.200">is enabling users to engage with your sites and give you a shot</p>

      <p begin="02:16:51.310" end="02:16:55.660">while we've grabbed a couple of these from chrome with just a few</p>
      <p begin="02:16:55.660" end="02:17:00.650">minor modifications and we're letting them up right here in microsoft edge so the first thing</p>

      <p begin="02:17:45.520" end="02:17:51.140">virtually no work to take this from the chrome extension store and run this is</p>
      <p begin="02:17:51.140" end="02:17:55.490">...html and javascript just running here ...part of an extension</p>
      <p begin="02:17:55.490" end="02:17:59.440">...another example which certainly matters in terms of user engagement up here</p>
      <p begin="02:17:59.440" end="02:18:04.430">you'll see we've added a pin trust extension to the browser tool bar and when I</p>
      <p begin="02:18:04.430" end="02:18:07.550">click that this is going to interact with the</p>

      <p begin="02:18:21.920" end="02:18:26.980">this sort of thing so with projects part with microsoft edge and</p>
      <p begin="02:18:26.980" end="02:18:30.920">the new support for these extensions you'll see how we're going to enable</p>

      <p begin="02:18:33.670" end="02:18:38.270">propped up on the web and as I said of course you could bring that into an app as well so you</p>

      <p begin="02:18:47.540" end="02:18:52.310">...what I'm going to do is change gears and talk about how the windows platform</p>
      <p begin="02:18:52.310" end="02:18:57.280">and universal windows apps make devices more valuable</p>
      <p begin="02:18:57.280" end="02:19:02.110">to end-users in general we have a vision an idea that</p>
      <p begin="02:19:02.110" end="02:19:06.740">the windows platform and apps written for it should be able to flex to different</p>
      <p begin="02:19:06.740" end="02:19:10.510">screen sizes and different input methods not by writing</p>
      <p begin="02:19:10.510" end="02:19:14.420">separate code but by having a platform that's smart enough to do in fact</p>
      <p begin="02:19:14.420" end="02:19:19.330">even dynamically on the same device we call this feature continuum it's a promise to</p>
      <p begin="02:19:19.330" end="02:19:23.400">...made along with our OEM partners that devices</p>
      <p begin="02:19:23.400" end="02:19:25.500">...so I want to show you some of the</p>
      <p begin="02:19:25.500" end="02:19:30.260">ways that continuum is evolving and I want to show you some of the ways that</p>
      <p begin="02:19:30.260" end="02:19:34.170">you're apps can light up a great continuum experience I'm going to start</p>
      <p begin="02:19:34.170" end="02:19:40.430">with eight-inch tablet this is a lenovo thinkpad it's running full windows it's</p>
      <p begin="02:19:40.430" end="02:19:45.670">got intel compatible part and the first thing you might notice of course I'm going to use this in tablet</p>
      <p begin="02:19:45.670" end="02:19:47.920">...you're looking at tablet mode but for those of you</p>
      <p begin="02:19:47.920" end="02:19:51.540">pay attention closely and especially if you've given us feedback our</p>
      <p begin="02:19:51.540" end="02:19:56.320">touch start in tablet mode we've simplified here we made the live tiles</p>
      <p begin="02:19:56.320" end="02:20:01.020">bigger this looks very familiar to windows eight users and the extra stuff</p>
      <p begin="02:20:01.020" end="02:20:05.790">you're most use list your sign in things like file explore settings the</p>
      <p begin="02:20:05.790" end="02:20:10.140">our switch are all over here I can navigate ...all ...all laps</p>
      <p begin="02:20:10.140" end="02:20:14.830">or showed nicely in this list we now have jumped lists working in here</p>
      <p begin="02:20:14.830" end="02:20:16.230">in a nice?</p>
      <p begin="02:20:16.230" end="02:20:21.230">Way with animation so on so it's really easy for me to navigate around my apps</p>
      <p begin="02:20:21.230" end="02:20:26.290">of course down here and the ...the system tasks which are I've got</p>
      <p begin="02:20:26.290" end="02:20:31.260">my task switching button which I can use to switch between lots of apps here's X so that's</p>
      <p begin="02:20:31.260" end="02:20:36.910">the excel for windows ten and I'm going to do here's jump into maps</p>
      <p begin="02:20:36.910" end="02:20:41.200">and do some navigation and the maps app here and I want to show you how this will scale to</p>
      <p begin="02:20:41.200" end="02:20:46.200">of more full pc like experience so, here I am in my map I'm going</p>
      <p begin="02:20:46.200" end="02:20:51.170">to go up here choose the favorites menu and down here in this panel</p>
      <p begin="02:20:51.170" end="02:20:55.900">on the bottom we're first going to navigate to new york city and I want to point out that the system</p>
      <p begin="02:20:55.900" end="02:20:59.480">UI now includes a global back button so I'll hit the back</p>
      <p begin="02:20:59.480" end="02:21:04.880">button the app navigate back and ...navigate to ...now what I'm going to do I want you</p>
      <p begin="02:21:04.880" end="02:21:09.840">to think about me using this in a very natural touch friendly way but now since</p>
      <p begin="02:21:09.840" end="02:21:13.990">the full pc ...bring it back to my office ...just going to docket</p>
      <p begin="02:21:13.990" end="02:21:18.790">in here and when I do I want you to notice how the maps app</p>
      <p begin="02:21:18.790" end="02:21:23.580">experience changes to adapt the panel that was on the bottom when I</p>
      <p begin="02:21:23.580" end="02:21:28.540">wasn't portrait mode is now on the left side and in fact when I,</p>
      <p begin="02:21:28.540" end="02:21:30.150">you know, restore this window</p>
      <p begin="02:21:30.150" end="02:21:34.940">I've now got my excel I've got my powerpoint all here running</p>
      <p begin="02:21:34.940" end="02:21:39.320">in a familiar way with windows that I can minimize and restore in pc</p>
      <p begin="02:21:39.320" end="02:21:43.450">mode so that's an example of continuum really helping me ...a small</p>
      <p begin="02:21:43.450" end="02:21:48.520">...the next example I want to show you that's new is here on this surface pro</p>
      <p begin="02:21:48.520" end="02:21:51.840">three where I have a rich complex ...</p>
      <p begin="02:21:51.840" end="02:21:57.260">thirty two app this is ...desks my it's a high-end heavily</p>
      <p begin="02:21:57.260" end="02:22:00.630">used very popular three-D authoring at and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="02:22:00.630" end="02:22:05.470">if you notice the you I've got lots of tool bar's and ...down here I've got the timeline or it might</p>
      <p begin="02:22:05.470" end="02:22:10.550">edit animation of my three-D character but imagine I'm an artist so I might use</p>
      <p begin="02:22:10.550" end="02:22:15.340">this docked with the big-screen keyboard mouse might use it like this but sometimes I'm going to</p>
      <p begin="02:22:15.340" end="02:22:19.770">remove the keyboard entirely and use it like a tablet and in this case here's</p>
      <p begin="02:22:19.770" end="02:22:24.570">...within thirty two app responding to that change in state in the system and adapting</p>
      <p begin="02:22:24.570" end="02:22:29.130">it's you ...and now I can use touch or I could use the pen to be able to</p>
      <p begin="02:22:29.130" end="02:22:33.670">do things like mark-up right on the character maybe it maybe I'm now going to be in</p>
      <p begin="02:22:33.670" end="02:22:37.210">this note where in this mode where I want to take notes for people</p>
      <p begin="02:22:37.210" end="02:22:42.060">at my team share my thoughts on the character the app flex is to take</p>
      <p begin="02:22:42.060" end="02:22:47.020">advantage of the use of the pen and touch as opposed to mouse and keyboard</p>
      <p begin="02:22:47.020" end="02:22:55.170">and in that case using win thirty two now I have one last thing I want to show thank you?</p>
      <p begin="02:22:55.170" end="02:22:58.330">I have one last thing I want to show up so far we've shown this</p>
      <p begin="02:22:58.330" end="02:23:03.170">continuum feature working with our shell and with apps on the PC and watching the</p>
      <p begin="02:23:03.170" end="02:23:07.220">pc device flex across these form factors but we have a</p>
      <p begin="02:23:07.220" end="02:23:11.920">vision that not only the pc can benefit from flexibility and use</p>
      <p begin="02:23:11.920" end="02:23:16.870">of input devices and screen sizes so ...can the phone so today</p>
      <p begin="02:23:16.870" end="02:23:20.210">we're excited to show for the first-time continuum</p>
      <p begin="02:23:20.210" end="02:23:24.960">for phones built into windows ten so let me give you look at how that</p>
      <p begin="02:23:24.960" end="02:23:30.110">works so over here I have now I've I should point out we need new hardware for this</p>
      <p begin="02:23:30.110" end="02:23:35.070">and I don't have that hardware working today fact we're going to try demo of that ...session on</p>
      <p begin="02:23:35.070" end="02:23:41.620">thursday so you're seeing a simulation I'm going to do is connect my phone and.</p>
      <p begin="02:23:41.620" end="02:23:44.420">Let's see you get this going.</p>
      <p begin="02:23:44.420" end="02:23:44.840">Once I</p>
      <p begin="02:23:44.840" end="02:23:49.820">connect my phone I want you to think of this I've got a bluetooth keyboard a bluetooth mouse</p>
      <p begin="02:23:49.820" end="02:23:54.070">and a screen just a screen that I'm connecting via html I</p>
      <p begin="02:23:54.070" end="02:23:59.020">ok so because this phone software has all the core component tree that's highly</p>
      <p begin="02:23:59.020" end="02:24:03.750">shared between the pc things like bluetooth keyboard mice their supported and,</p>
      <p begin="02:24:03.750" end="02:24:09.020">you might notice I'm not sure if the shot shows this but at the top of my phone street now it says</p>
      <p begin="02:24:09.020" end="02:24:13.800">...for mouse and keyboard controller I could tap that then get essentially a mouse pad on</p>
      <p begin="02:24:13.800" end="02:24:17.950">my phone but I don't need to do that because I have a full bluetooth mouse and</p>
      <p begin="02:24:17.950" end="02:24:22.690">keyboard right here up here on the monitor you'll notice this looks very familiar I mean</p>
      <p begin="02:24:22.690" end="02:24:27.070">...the same start menu with tiles I had my phone now displayed like a</p>
      <p begin="02:24:27.070" end="02:24:30.580">start menu and I want to start running apps to give you a sense of how</p>
      <p begin="02:24:30.580" end="02:24:34.710">well the phone experience transforms through continuing to give you</p>
      <p begin="02:24:34.710" end="02:24:38.960">a very PC like experience first launch powerpoint this is</p>
      <p begin="02:24:38.960" end="02:24:43.070">...version of powerpoint that comes with the phone and,</p>
      <p begin="02:24:43.070" end="02:24:47.280">what you see on the big-screen here sure looks like the version of powerpoint that you would</p>
      <p begin="02:24:47.280" end="02:24:51.650">see a pc because in fact it is the same code as the version of</p>
      <p begin="02:24:51.650" end="02:24:56.180">powerpoint that you would download from the store and see on a pc I can do things</p>
      <p begin="02:24:56.180" end="02:25:00.960">like use my mouse and keyboard to create a new slide ...go up here use the ribbon</p>
      <p begin="02:25:00.960" end="02:25:05.530">to insert pictures remember this is my phone so as I'm inserting</p>
      <p begin="02:25:05.530" end="02:25:10.610">the photos I bring up my photos this is the camera role of my phone and</p>
      <p begin="02:25:10.610" end="02:25:15.510">the photos that I've synched from one drive I'll choose an appropriate desert picture from a</p>
      <p begin="02:25:15.510" end="02:25:19.960">trip I made to utah and I'll insert that into my powerpoint presentation</p>
      <p begin="02:25:19.960" end="02:25:23.540">...completely natural and familiar way using the keyboard and</p>
      <p begin="02:25:23.540" end="02:25:26.840">mouse let's look at some other examples ...click here to go</p>
      <p begin="02:25:26.840" end="02:25:31.780">into male and the outlook mail client that comes with windows ten</p>
      <p begin="02:25:31.780" end="02:25:36.640">pcs and comes with phones is now viewed and it looks completely familiar here's</p>
      <p begin="02:25:36.640" end="02:25:40.630">my mail folders I can choose a message in my inbox and over here</p>
      <p begin="02:25:40.630" end="02:25:45.570">...click the reply button or I have the full our of the word engine embedded</p>
      <p begin="02:25:45.570" end="02:25:50.290">...outlook for doing replies and there's the familiar ribbon you can see here and,</p>
      <p begin="02:25:50.290" end="02:25:53.940">is asking me to update the latest expense report eric's going to give me</p>
      <p begin="02:25:53.940" end="02:25:58.910">the december expenses so I'm going to switch over here to excel where we're doing</p>
      <p begin="02:25:58.910" end="02:26:02.990">arcs spence reporting and you'll see here's excel the universal</p>
      <p begin="02:26:02.990" end="02:26:07.640">windows app excel running on the phone but looking the same as it</p>
      <p begin="02:26:07.640" end="02:26:12.420">...on the pc I'll choose the my expense reporting app and look at this my</p>
      <p begin="02:26:12.420" end="02:26:17.490">phone just buzz I got a text from eric right there I'm going to click</p>
      <p begin="02:26:17.490" end="02:26:22.310">to navigate on my phone screen separately to my text app ...</p>
      <p begin="02:26:22.310" end="02:26:27.980">...hold to get the context ...choose copy because I'm going to copy from that</p>
      <p begin="02:26:27.980" end="02:26:31.890">tax ...here to my a december cell</p>
      <p begin="02:26:31.890" end="02:26:36.880">and of course my brain is wired to know the keyboard shortcuts for all these apps</p>
      <p begin="02:26:36.880" end="02:26:42.920">I'll hit control v to pace I'll use my task switch or to come back to</p>
      <p begin="02:26:42.920" end="02:26:53.820">the outlook e-mail client and I can do a quick reply and sent?</p>
      <p begin="02:26:53.820" end="02:26:55.570">Think about this.</p>
      <p begin="02:26:55.570" end="02:26:57.610">With continuum for phones we believe</p>
      <p begin="02:26:57.610" end="02:27:00.770">...screen can be your pc.</p>
      <p begin="02:27:00.770" end="02:27:05.450">Imagine that your company has a touchdown space where anyone could connect</p>
      <p begin="02:27:05.450" end="02:27:10.340">their tablet or their phone took keyboards mice and screens and then use their</p>
      <p begin="02:27:10.340" end="02:27:14.920">apps with their data and the full our of a keyboard and mouse</p>
      <p begin="02:27:14.920" end="02:27:19.170">or imagine you're on vacation and your hotel room can become a</p>
      <p begin="02:27:19.170" end="02:27:23.810">theater or you connect your phone to the screen you let your kids watch a movie while you use</p>
      <p begin="02:27:23.810" end="02:27:26.490">the second screen to catch up on your email</p>
      <p begin="02:27:26.490" end="02:27:30.690">I imagine the effect this can have on mobile first countries or individuals could</p>
      <p begin="02:27:30.690" end="02:27:35.440">be as productive with the phone that they're buying if they can't buy a full</p>
      <p begin="02:27:35.440" end="02:27:39.890">pc so what we're trying to show here today with continuum is</p>
      <p begin="02:27:39.890" end="02:27:44.850">our unique vision for phones and enabling them to scale-up to a full</p>
      <p begin="02:27:44.850" end="02:27:49.090">pc like experience and what we have so far is just the first step</p>
      <p begin="02:27:49.090" end="02:27:53.200">because it requires all of you writing these universal windows apps</p>
      <p begin="02:27:53.200" end="02:27:57.760">whose you why can scale and it just a different form factors input types and</p>

      <p begin="02:33:16.550" end="02:33:20.560">in our homes this stage as an example is modeled after</p>
