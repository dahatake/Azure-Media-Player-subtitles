      <p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:34.180">three players so what we did is we took the package from steam ran it through the converter and turn it</p>
      <p begin="00:55:34.180" end="00:55:38.610">on modern desktop application so let's launch it to see how it runs you can see</p>
      <p begin="00:55:38.610" end="00:55:43.210">it launch our splash screen.</p>

      <p begin="00:56:05.610" end="00:56:10.560">against the running when the running version of the game here and they would work just fine but I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:56:10.560" end="00:56:12.610">actually boot the game?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:12.610" end="00:56:17.220">And, just show use proof is here.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:17.220" end="00:56:21.030">And, there you go so age do eights d running as a modern desktop</p>

      <p begin="00:56:44.620" end="00:56:53.190">the same converter let me show you how it works so here is find the start menu.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.190" end="00:56:58.460">It's bigger game takes a bit longer load.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:58.460" end="00:57:04.840">It is so what you'll see a moi.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04.840" end="00:57:14.450">Is there it is the witcher to running a full frame rate as a modern desktop application?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:14.450" end="00:57:16.200">This allows these games</p>
      <p begin="00:57:16.200" end="00:57:21.000">to take advantage of the common services and technology and both xbox</p>
      <p begin="00:57:21.000" end="00:57:25.830">in windows tent things like platform-specific features like live tile support</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25.830" end="00:57:30.190">notifications like you just saw in this demo and kevin's demo earlier we</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.190" end="00:57:34.560">have consistent input support with controller and mouse and keyboard across all</p>

      <p begin="00:57:41.420" end="00:57:46.270">We've said from the start we want xbox one to be a great place for games</p>
      <p begin="00:57:46.270" end="00:57:51.180">and also a great place for developers of all sizes so you can create new games</p>
      <p begin="00:57:51.180" end="00:57:54.590">and application experiences today I</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.590" end="00:57:58.830">am pleased to announce xbox dev mode giving developers the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:58.830" end="00:58:05.530">ability to convert their retail xbox one into a development kit.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:05.530" end="00:58:10.400">Please welcome axes biker from our xbox platform team to show us how</p>
      <p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:15.390">thanks ashley we are building a truly universal platform where your apps run everywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15.390" end="00:58:20.220">including the xbox one which provides a huge opportunity for app developers to bring</p>
      <p begin="00:58:20.220" end="00:58:25.170">their experiences to life in the living room so now I'm going to show you how anyone can take</p>
      <p begin="00:58:25.170" end="00:58:30.590">a retail xbox one and turn it into a dev kit.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:30.590" end="00:58:35.560">I was playing forts over here but I really want to do is work on my app ash photo which I'll show</p>
      <p begin="00:58:35.560" end="00:58:39.910">you in a minute but first I need to put my consul into dev mode.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39.910" end="00:58:40.920">So, go over here</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.920" end="00:58:45.720">now run the dev mode activation app which I've already downloaded from the store.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.720" end="00:58:50.140">This app allows you to register your consul as a deb consul which I've already done using my</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.140" end="00:58:53.620">same account in dead-center where I submit all my other uw</p>
      <p begin="00:58:53.620" end="00:59:00.570">p applications this means that I can switch to dev mode with a single button press.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00.570" end="00:59:04.830">Once the xbox is finished rebooting it will be in dev mode which means I can</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.830" end="00:59:09.040">deploy and debug my app now while attributing let's go over here to</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:15.030">the pc and look at asch photo running on the pc where I'm actually writing.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.030" end="00:59:19.130">So, you can see how the ui elements move and adjust as a change the size of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:19.130" end="00:59:25.370">the window and now let's see how we can deploy this theme app to the xbox one</p>
      <p begin="00:59:25.370" end="00:59:28.450">so I'll stop debugging over here on the pc and I'll switch</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.450" end="00:59:33.610">local machine to remote machine this is the ip address of my xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:33.610" end="00:59:35.430">And, then the signal.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35.430" end="00:59:40.360">And, since I've already paired visual studio with my xbox I can do a remote deploy just like</p>
      <p begin="00:59:40.360" end="00:59:44.280">any other universal windows device.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.010" end="00:59:55.010">Right so that's my consul in years my app running on my xbox one so,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.010" end="00:59:59.240">this is the exact same code that we were just debugging over here but now that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.240" end="01:00:03.490">it's on the consul you can tell that it's been optimized for the living room.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:03.490" end="01:00:07.470">Good news is that the universal windows platform did a lot of the heavy lifting,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:07.470" end="01:00:10.580">for example, the controller just works</p>
      <p begin="01:00:10.580" end="01:00:15.140">all xaml controls have already been optimized to work with the game bad just like you would</p>
      <p begin="01:00:15.140" end="01:00:20.060">expect including focus navigation and not just on xbox.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.060" end="01:00:24.630">Works the same way and the desktop when you have a controller plugged in fact all</p>
      <p begin="01:00:24.630" end="01:00:32.460">the xaml controls are designed to work great with touch mouse and controller.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:32.460" end="01:00:34.800">Helpful life.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:34.800" end="01:00:36.660">It also means that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.660" end="01:00:42.540">you can continue to test when you don't have your xbox look in your flight back home.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.540" end="01:00:46.690">Now since this is a universal windows application it also have access to the same</p>
      <p begin="01:00:46.690" end="01:00:51.400">universal apis including apis for speech recognition and synthesis so</p>
      <p begin="01:00:51.400" end="01:00:56.080">I've added a fun feature which allows me to add speech bubbles to my photos I can simply use</p>
      <p begin="01:00:56.080" end="01:01:00.520">the speech recognizer to fill them in which an xbox is way</p>
      <p begin="01:01:00.520" end="01:01:09.020">easier than typing so let me show you how this works will caption this photo right now.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:09.020" end="01:01:12.710">Lions bark right.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:12.710" end="01:01:15.710">Boom there we go.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:15.710" end="01:01:18.870">So, much easier than typing.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:18.870" end="01:01:22.420">Ok, I want to show you guys one more thing so in addition to the</p>
      <p begin="01:01:22.420" end="01:01:25.520">dev mode activation app I showed earlier there's another app</p>
      <p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:31.760">called dev home which will automatically get loaded on your consul once you've put it in dev mode.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.590">And, when you run it has everything you need is a developer from anything from account management to</p>
      <p begin="01:01:36.590" end="01:01:41.090">developer settings most importantly once I'm done working on my app</p>
      <p begin="01:01:41.090" end="01:01:44.810">for the night and I want to go back to playing forza I can just go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="01:01:44.810" end="01:01:49.200">press leave developer mode and back to retail mode?</p>
      <p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:57.710">I should mention that a preview of dev mode will be available starting today.</p>

      <p begin="01:12:49.730" end="01:12:54.090">And, students need to understand not only how these parts fit together but how</p>
      <p begin="01:12:54.090" end="01:12:58.990">they work together henry can you tell us which organ in the body</p>

      <p begin="01:13:07.200" end="01:13:13.370">but thankfully with hololens it's really easy to get the best view of things.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:13.370" end="01:13:17.860">Now another area that's difficult for our students to fully grasp is the nervous</p>

      <p begin="01:21:05.340" end="01:21:10.430">also are really excited about I think the opportunities the new frontiers.</p>

      <p begin="01:21:30.860" end="01:21:35.570">are now switch gears to talk about this conversation as a platform.</p>
      <p begin="01:21:35.570" end="01:21:38.590">As I said this is at the confluence of all of</p>

      <p begin="01:21:46.180" end="01:21:48.800">you know, best brought a whole with an anecdote.</p>
      <p begin="01:21:49.870" end="01:21:54.200">That she knew shared with me about is mall.</p>
      <p begin="01:21:54.200" end="01:21:58.640">Yahoo's eighty-years-old lives in china she has been try to use because of</p>
      <p begin="01:21:58.640" end="01:22:03.580">cheese influence computers and she found it very hard even the</p>
      <p begin="01:22:03.580" end="01:22:09.110">web although it was one of the greatest democratizing forces of computing she found</p>
      <p begin="01:22:09.110" end="01:22:13.030">it hard to navigate between websites was uncomfortable clicking on</p>

      <p begin="01:22:22.830" end="01:22:27.820">was difficult so she never got around using it was using sms and</p>
      <p begin="01:22:27.820" end="01:22:32.650">now with wechat she's able to at the age of eighty not</p>
      <p begin="01:22:32.650" end="01:22:38.150">only have all the conversations with people seamlessly but</p>
      <p begin="01:22:38.150" end="01:22:43.730">she's also able to interact with businesses and</p>
      <p begin="01:22:43.730" end="01:22:46.150">And, that shows the our.</p>
      <p begin="01:22:46.150" end="01:22:47.280">Of human language.</p>
      <p begin="01:22:48.290" end="01:22:52.240">We want to take that our of human language and as I said earlier</p>
      <p begin="01:22:52.240" end="01:22:57.150">apply it more pervasively to all of the computing interface and</p>
      <p begin="01:22:57.150" end="01:23:02.970">the computing interaction and to do that though you have to infuse.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:02.970" end="01:23:07.960">Into computers and computing around us intelligence that means you</p>
      <p begin="01:23:07.960" end="01:23:12.890">have to bring forth these technologies of artificial intelligence and machine</p>
      <p begin="01:23:12.890" end="01:23:17.670">learning so that we can teach computers to learn.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:17.670" end="01:23:22.860">Human language have conversational understanding teach them about</p>
      <p begin="01:23:22.860" end="01:23:27.020">the broad context people places things.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:27.020" end="01:23:31.790">Context about your preferences your personal knowledge.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:31.790" end="01:23:35.860">So, that they can really help you with your everyday tasks</p>
      <p begin="01:23:35.860" end="01:23:41.470">and everyday life both at work and elsewhere.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:41.470" end="01:23:42.960">So, as we infuse.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:44.690" end="01:23:45.490">Intelligence</p>
      <p begin="01:23:45.490" end="01:23:51.620">into everything I think it's very important to have a principled approach.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:51.620" end="01:23:56.220">a way to guide our design as well as how we build things?</p>
      <p begin="01:23:56.220" end="01:24:01.190">So, at microsoft we are focused on an approach that grounded in our</p>
      <p begin="01:24:01.190" end="01:24:06.090">mission to empower people and organizations all over the planet to achieve model</p>
      <p begin="01:24:06.090" end="01:24:11.670">the three core principles here first we want to build</p>
      <p begin="01:24:11.670" end="01:24:16.490">intelligence that augments human abilities and</p>
      <p begin="01:24:16.490" end="01:24:22.360">experiences ultimately it's not going to be about man versus machine</p>
      <p begin="01:24:22.360" end="01:24:26.260">is going to be about man with machines each of us</p>
      <p begin="01:24:26.260" end="01:24:29.310">excel a very different things.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:29.310" end="01:24:35.120">The fact that we have creativity empathy emotion.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:35.120" end="01:24:38.020">And, judgment.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:38.020" end="01:24:42.850">That can then be mixed with fast computation the ability to reason over large amounts of</p>
      <p begin="01:24:42.850" end="01:24:47.440">data and do pattern recognition fast it's that bringing together</p>
      <p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:53.190">that I think is going to help us move our society forward?</p>
      <p begin="01:24:53.190" end="01:24:57.420">We also have to build trust right into our technology that means.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:57.420" end="01:25:02.230">You have to have technology that has built-in protections for privacy</p>
      <p begin="01:25:02.230" end="01:25:08.770">east got transparency you have security as well as compliance.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:08.770" end="01:25:09.420">And, lastly.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:10.450" end="01:25:16.490">All technology that we build to be more inclusive and respectful</p>
      <p begin="01:25:16.490" end="01:25:22.620">we need to build technology so that more people can use technology.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:22.620" end="01:25:23.190">And, we want</p>
      <p begin="01:25:23.190" end="01:25:32.140">to build technology such that it gets the best of humanity not the worst.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:32.140" end="01:25:35.670">this is already guiding us as we build skype translate.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:36.680" end="01:25:41.580">To have conversational understanding as we build out cortana to have</p>
      <p begin="01:25:41.580" end="01:25:50.770">more expertise as we build hololens to have environmental understanding.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:50.770" end="01:25:54.040">Reuse this approach when we get it wrong in fact just last week when we</p>
      <p begin="01:25:54.040" end="01:25:58.700">launched our incubation tay which is a social bot in the united states</p>
      <p begin="01:25:58.700" end="01:26:03.440">we quickly realized that it was not up to this mark.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:03.440" end="01:26:06.640">So, we're back to the drawing board.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:06.640" end="01:26:10.680">Why we continue to incubate xiaoice and rina in</p>
      <p begin="01:26:10.680" end="01:26:17.640">china and japan and learn why is it that the social bots there'd work differently?</p>
      <p begin="01:26:17.640" end="01:26:21.930">And, that's how we want to make progress this approach is always going to be</p>
      <p begin="01:26:21.930" end="01:26:25.470">front-and-center to us.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:25.470" end="01:26:27.700">When we talk about conversations as a platform</p>
      <p begin="01:26:29.160" end="01:26:34.430">that reactors there's baths people?</p>
      <p begin="01:26:34.430" end="01:26:39.020">We want to be able to have the most natural conversations with other</p>
      <p begin="01:26:39.020" end="01:26:40.480">people.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:40.480" end="01:26:42.980">We want in fact to enrich our</p>
      <p begin="01:26:42.980" end="01:26:47.470">conversations and skype translate is a fantastic example of that because I'm able to</p>
      <p begin="01:26:47.470" end="01:26:51.420">talking to different languages and really have automatic translation</p>
      <p begin="01:26:52.570" end="01:26:57.040">we also have presence you saw in the holographic</p>
      <p begin="01:26:57.040" end="01:27:01.370">demo how you can have remote presence.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:01.370" end="01:27:07.950">These are all ways for us to enhance human conversations.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:07.950" end="01:27:14.990">But, we want to take that same our of human conversations and applied to everything</p>
      <p begin="01:27:14.990" end="01:27:18.370">And, that's where these other actors come in a personal digital</p>
      <p begin="01:27:18.370" end="01:27:23.350">assistant that knows you knows about your world is always with you</p>
      <p begin="01:27:23.350" end="01:27:29.170">across all your devices helping you with your everyday tasks.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:29.170" end="01:27:34.760">And, bots are like new applications that you converse with</p>
      <p begin="01:27:34.760" end="01:27:37.620">you're not really looking for multiple applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:39.180" end="01:27:43.350">Pages and pages a websites or apps but you just able</p>
      <p begin="01:27:43.350" end="01:27:50.870">to call on any application as a bot right within a conversational canvas.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:50.870" end="01:27:54.780">So, this is the rich world of conversations that we envision people-to-people</p>
      <p begin="01:27:55.790" end="01:28:01.280">people to your personal digital assistant people-to-bots and</p>
      <p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:06.230">even personal digital assistants calling on bots on your behalf.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:06.230" end="01:28:15.540">That's the world that you're going to get to see in the years to come.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:15.540" end="01:28:19.610">So, you can conceptualize this platform.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:19.610" end="01:28:20.800">Where human language?</p>
      <p begin="01:28:21.840" end="01:28:25.510">Is the new ui layer?</p>
      <p begin="01:28:25.510" end="01:28:29.830">Bots are like new applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:29.830" end="01:28:36.250">And, digital assistants are meta apps for like the new browsers.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:36.250" end="01:28:40.720">And, intelligence is infused into all of your interactions</p>
      <p begin="01:28:40.720" end="01:28:46.640">that's the rich platform that we have.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:46.640" end="01:28:47.430">So, let's start.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:48.570" end="01:28:51.490">By talking about cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:51.490" end="01:28:54.110">We introduced cortana two years ago and</p>
      <p begin="01:28:54.110" end="01:28:57.700">ever since then it's becoming smarter every day.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:58.750" end="01:29:01.950">Because of its ability to know you.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:02.960" end="01:29:06.800">To know about your organization to know about the world</p>
      <p begin="01:29:06.800" end="01:29:11.580">and reason about all of this on a continuous basis.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:11.580" end="01:29:14.580">It's built natively into windows.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:14.580" end="01:29:16.740">But, it's not limited to windows</p>
      <p begin="01:29:16.740" end="01:29:19.870">it's going to be available on all your devices</p>
      <p begin="01:29:19.870" end="01:29:23.140">whether ios android across all of your applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:24.520" end="01:29:29.370">Because if it's going to be a useful personal digital assistant it has to be about</p>
      <p begin="01:29:29.370" end="01:29:33.520">new not a single device and that's really</p>
      <p begin="01:29:33.520" end="01:29:41.480">how we are building out cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:41.480" end="01:29:46.140">And, we're also making it such that the expertise of cortana is</p>

      <p begin="01:29:56.720" end="01:30:01.010">in their applications this services into cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:30:01.010" end="01:30:05.150">so that can further drive engagement for their applications</p>
      <p begin="01:30:05.150" end="01:30:10.000">and services that developer opportunity is something that we want to talk about so to show</p>

      <p begin="01:32:17.620" end="01:32:26.480">she helps me get stuff done here's an early preview of some new experiences that will release the coming months.</p>
      <p begin="01:32:26.480" end="01:32:28.570">Notice that cortana is coming to outlook and</p>
      <p begin="01:32:28.570" end="01:32:32.920">scheduled some appointments for me it's the blue with the circle.</p>
      <p begin="01:32:32.920" end="01:32:36.190">The idea there is cortana is now in outlook and</p>
      <p begin="01:32:36.190" end="01:32:39.780">she looking at my email and my calendar with my permission and</p>
      <p begin="01:32:39.780" end="01:32:44.470">helping me get things done stay on top of things a good example this week I was exchanging a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="01:32:44.470" end="01:32:49.180">email with our microsoft travel service trying to figure out the best time to get home on friday</p>
      <p begin="01:32:49.180" end="01:32:52.720">cortana is able to understand that conversation about me doing anything adding</p>
      <p begin="01:32:52.720" end="01:33:00.240">create appointment she automatically put all that flight information my counter to make it really easy for me to track.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:00.240" end="01:33:04.020">She applies the same conversational intelligence to help me stay on top of commitments</p>
      <p begin="01:33:04.020" end="01:33:08.570">in email I get a ton of email which makes it easy for me to forget things I said</p>
      <p begin="01:33:08.570" end="01:33:11.860">I would do so here cortana is flagged something I said</p>
      <p begin="01:33:11.860" end="01:33:16.740">semi manager today I was actually going to get ahead of this on the plane but the siren song of</p>
      <p begin="01:33:16.740" end="01:33:21.600">that flight infotainment system gap me again no problem cortana is there and she</p>
      <p begin="01:33:21.600" end="01:33:28.810">knows the last time I made an update she knows where the document as I can ask a good take care of this warming.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:28.810" end="01:33:34.490">Send chuck the powerpoint that are worked on last night.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:34.490" end="01:33:40.280">Sure, thing I found this powerpoint document is this it.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:40.280" end="01:33:42.430">I go ahead and get that sent.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:42.430" end="01:33:49.460">Since cortana is not bound to specific device thank you thank you.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:49.460" end="01:33:54.190">Now since cortana is not bound to a specific device she helps me keep track of notifications that are</p>
      <p begin="01:33:54.190" end="01:33:58.490">happening right here my android phone while I'm doing work on my pc.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:58.490" end="01:34:03.280">So, here I've got a notification a text message that came in from my friend ben he's here in the bay area</p>
      <p begin="01:34:03.280" end="01:34:06.200">what's michigan together go blue and we were talking about</p>
      <p begin="01:34:06.200" end="01:34:12.530">get-together after the keynote any michigan grads out there we go for.</p>
      <p begin="01:34:12.530" end="01:34:24.800">I can go ahead and respond right here for my pc.</p>
      <p begin="01:34:24.800" end="01:34:27.930">Cortana knows that I'm talking about meeting with ben she offers to add</p>
      <p begin="01:34:27.930" end="01:34:28.810">this to my calendar.</p>
      <p begin="01:34:30.010" end="01:34:33.420">And, then she tells me got a couple of other things there can I help you movies.</p>
      <p begin="01:34:34.440" end="01:34:39.490">But, see then are some work-related stuff I choose ben and what she did</p>
      <p begin="01:34:39.490" end="01:34:42.120">there is appointments from noon on wednesday</p>
      <p begin="01:34:42.120" end="01:34:51.110">automatically shift to the appointment the free block of time I have there on thursday?</p>
      <p begin="01:34:51.110" end="01:34:55.080">Now since that meeting with ben is over lunch you can see here the cortana is brought</p>
      <p begin="01:34:55.080" end="01:34:59.970">in some proactive actions that she thinks can help me cortana has a team of experts</p>
      <p begin="01:34:59.970" end="01:35:04.910">that she relies on this idea that cortana doesn't need to know everything she can go and ask experts</p>
      <p begin="01:35:04.910" end="01:35:09.610">for health experts are all of you developers that are creating these amazing apps and services that can integrate</p>
      <p begin="01:35:09.610" end="01:35:14.450">right into cortana so the cases this meetings over lunch I might want to book a table</p>
      <p begin="01:35:14.450" end="01:35:18.910">we might not have time so I might need to bring in some food or she can offer some helpful</p>
      <p begin="01:35:18.910" end="01:35:24.140">suggestions about things to do here you can see a bunch of options city food tour sounds great</p>
      <p begin="01:35:24.140" end="01:35:29.460">here some information about that notice the option to buy tickets.</p>
      <p begin="01:35:29.460" end="01:35:34.390">Extensibility also means help me get that action done here create a very simple sample application</p>
      <p begin="01:35:34.390" end="01:35:39.280">city food tour notice cortana is passed in some context for me there are two of us in the meeting</p>
      <p begin="01:35:39.280" end="01:35:46.650">invite here some other information I can confirm my order now I've got tickets purchased.</p>
      <p begin="01:35:46.650" end="01:35:51.020">This same experience also works for business applications so the next time I go to cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:35:51.020" end="01:35:55.130">she's queuing up another thing she thinks I might want to work on in this case I took a taxi</p>
      <p begin="01:35:55.130" end="01:35:59.800">last night and cortana found out there was a receipt my email and she's</p>
      <p begin="01:35:59.800" end="01:36:03.970">offered to help me put that into my expense report we use the microsoft expense</p>
      <p begin="01:36:03.970" end="01:36:08.810">application internally to track this kind of thing when I click on that notice that all of the</p>
      <p begin="01:36:08.810" end="01:36:14.100">information and details map receipt are put into that application.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:14.100" end="01:36:20.210">And, I go ahead and add choose to save that.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:20.210" end="01:36:25.000">Since cortana is not bound to a particular device I can finish all these tasks here</p>
      <p begin="01:36:25.000" end="01:36:26.900">on my android phone.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:26.900" end="01:36:31.960">So, when I go ahead launch cortana?</p>
      <p begin="01:36:31.960" end="01:36:35.300">You can see that my meeting with ben is here and I got the tickets to the food city</p>
      <p begin="01:36:35.300" end="01:36:40.210">tours the microsoft expense application here I go ahead and choose to submit that</p>
      <p begin="01:36:41.510" end="01:36:45.940">and it's all taken care of since the phone as my most personal device</p>
      <p begin="01:36:45.940" end="01:36:50.890">its with me all the time cortana can augment me in very interesting ways so I</p>
      <p begin="01:36:50.890" end="01:36:54.980">have a five-year-old son and I started this tradition two years ago when I</p>
      <p begin="01:36:54.980" end="01:36:58.960">brought him home a toy from a business trip.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:58.960" end="01:37:03.100">Now every time daddy goes in a business trip little man thinks</p>
      <p begin="01:37:03.100" end="01:37:07.480">is birthday and daddy better deliver and bring home yet another toy I</p>
      <p begin="01:37:07.480" end="01:37:11.450">don't remember the name of the toy store that I went to last year was here but it</p>
      <p begin="01:37:11.450" end="01:37:19.290">had great transformers and things that he wants so since cortana is with me she can help enhance my memory.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:19.290" end="01:37:28.630">What toy store did I go to last year at build?</p>
      <p begin="01:37:28.630" end="01:37:34.160">You can see she finds the correct toy store again she brings in helpful proactive actions.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:34.160" end="01:37:38.850">Now let me show you how easy it is to create these actions.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:38.850" end="01:37:42.610">Here on the developer portal today we're announcing an invite-based preview</p>
      <p begin="01:37:42.610" end="01:37:49.180">for proactive actions and here's the portal that you can use to connect your apps and websites to cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:49.180" end="01:37:49.390">I want</p>

      <p begin="01:38:02.500" end="01:38:06.450">Instead of fumbling around trying to figure out how to send a text message and figure out what am I going to</p>
      <p begin="01:38:06.450" end="01:38:10.560">get there and I really going to get there at the time I think I can just send a glimpse which gives</p>
      <p begin="01:38:10.560" end="01:38:16.990">all the attendees real-time tracking of me with a map and tells me my expected eta.</p>

      <p begin="01:38:28.190" end="01:38:32.490">only a few steps the first thing you do is you go and add insights,</p>
      <p begin="01:38:32.490" end="01:38:36.220">insights control when cortana surfaces your action.</p>
      <p begin="01:38:36.220" end="01:38:41.060">That's this column right here this column is the contextual info this is the information that you want</p>
      <p begin="01:38:41.060" end="01:38:45.970">your app to request from customers so that just eat example just eat would like to know</p>
      <p begin="01:38:45.970" end="01:38:54.220">my cuisine preferences because they can do a much better job of give-me helpful suggestions if they knew that I love sushi.</p>
      <p begin="01:38:54.220" end="01:38:58.030">Customers are always in control of data that cortana shares so she's always going</p>
      <p begin="01:38:58.030" end="01:39:03.380">to ask permission before any data sent applications and services.</p>
      <p begin="01:39:03.380" end="01:39:07.690">Here the deep links that you create open your app these deep links are</p>

      <p begin="01:39:19.100" end="01:39:23.430">And, then finally some metadata that you ads that shows how the experience shows up</p>
      <p begin="01:39:23.430" end="01:39:31.080">in the cortana ui along with an icon.</p>
      <p begin="01:39:31.080" end="01:39:35.380">So, here you can see a sample appointment and both glimpse and just eat</p>
      <p begin="01:39:35.380" end="01:39:38.020">are here as actions it only take took just</p>

      <p begin="01:40:10.080" end="01:40:14.730">with you and for developers it represents a new opportunity for</p>

      <p begin="01:40:21.420" end="01:40:27.480">services and then register them as extensions and insights and action.</p>
      <p begin="01:40:27.480" end="01:40:30.400">So, we want to now move to another</p>
      <p begin="01:40:30.400" end="01:40:35.230">canvas another set of tools where conversations are taking place these</p>

      <p begin="01:44:02.790" end="01:44:07.490">there are some new things in this next generation of skype you see this visual video mail so</p>
      <p begin="01:44:07.490" end="01:44:11.730">we have a video message with the transcript right below this is one of the examples where</p>
      <p begin="01:44:11.730" end="01:44:16.620">we taking intelligence from things like skype translator and bringing them directly into everyday features</p>
      <p begin="01:44:16.620" end="01:44:21.300">like video messages and narrative is telling me the team has sent me a little something</p>
      <p begin="01:44:21.300" end="01:44:27.830">so that's really nice I'll send him a quick little happy emoticon so in this next generation of</p>
      <p begin="01:44:27.830" end="01:44:32.030">said the other thing that you'll notice in the canvas is my personal assistant cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:44:32.030" end="01:44:36.740">is always there in the upper right-hand corner cortana is there if I want to talk</p>
      <p begin="01:44:36.740" end="01:44:41.440">to her one-on-one or in a group or even as you can see here she subtly</p>
      <p begin="01:44:41.440" end="01:44:47.580">improving my messages by highlighting key points in my text like codess.</p>
      <p begin="01:44:47.580" end="01:44:51.160">So, I can tap on codess you see this rich card powered by bing that showing us</p>
      <p begin="01:44:51.160" end="01:44:54.210">set code is a real organization that microsoft</p>
      <p begin="01:44:54.210" end="01:45:01.710">sponsors to really promote women in technology which is something that I'm very passionate about.</p>
      <p begin="01:45:01.710" end="01:45:06.080">So, now you see cortana is actually sending me a private message I'm going to tap that and I</p>
      <p begin="01:45:06.080" end="01:45:10.740">go into the one-on-one conversation I have with cortana so she's telling me the</p>
      <p begin="01:45:10.740" end="01:45:17.800">custom cakes bot would like to know my location for delivery and yes I'll share it.</p>
      <p begin="01:45:17.800" end="01:45:24.040">And, what I like to track delivery also yes I'll share it so right away what you're seeing here is that?</p>
      <p begin="01:45:24.040" end="01:45:25.290">The agent cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:45:25.290" end="01:45:29.800">is actually brokering the conversation with the third-party bot the custom cakes bot</p>
      <p begin="01:45:30.980" end="01:45:35.780">now I see this rich card that is showing me that the cupcake is on its way and that</p>
      <p begin="01:45:35.780" end="01:45:40.760">it will be here within a few minutes all of this is happening within my skype chats.</p>
      <p begin="01:45:40.760" end="01:45:43.080">This is just one example of the many ways that you're going to</p>
      <p begin="01:45:43.080" end="01:45:49.770">start seeing businesses using the our of skype and cortana to interact with their customers.</p>
      <p begin="01:45:49.770" end="01:45:51.590">Now since I'm already talking to cortana and</p>
      <p begin="01:45:51.590" end="01:45:57.320">I've committed to doing this keynote I'm going-to go ahead and try to plan the rest of my trip.</p>
      <p begin="01:45:57.320" end="01:46:06.970">Please block my calendar for codess from april ten through april twelfth.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:06.970" end="01:46:10.470">These other used push talk because I didn't feel like typing.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:10.470" end="01:46:13.150">And, reilly everything your notice here is that cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:46:13.150" end="01:46:17.700">actually has context for my previous chat with gurdeep so even though I just told that the</p>
      <p begin="01:46:17.700" end="01:46:24.760">date it actually knows the location and, you know, that its from the conversation with gurdeep.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:24.760" end="01:46:29.320">Now cortana is proactively thinking about the next steps in coordinating my trip so</p>
      <p begin="01:46:29.320" end="01:46:33.840">she's actually suggesting that I connect with the westin bot anybody that knows me knows I normally stay at</p>
      <p begin="01:46:33.840" end="01:46:37.940">a westin bot and I'm so you see here now is cortana has actually</p>
      <p begin="01:46:37.940" end="01:46:41.930">introduced the westin bot into the conversation but not only has</p>
      <p begin="01:46:41.930" end="01:46:44.440">he done that she has given the westin bot</p>
      <p begin="01:46:44.440" end="01:46:48.990">context so I don't have to repeat myself the westin bot knows this is for dublin and</p>
      <p begin="01:46:48.990" end="01:46:54.830">its for those particular dates all of this saves me a lot of time and effort.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:54.830" end="01:47:00.950">Now there are suggested rooms I'm going to choose the normal room.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:00.950" end="01:47:04.980">Confirmation and just like that into simple steps I was able to</p>
      <p begin="01:47:04.980" end="01:47:17.830">block my calendar and also book my hotel room.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:17.830" end="01:47:26.860">Now there's nothing else the westin bot can do for me so I m going to say no thank you.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:26.860" end="01:47:31.330">And, now because cortana has all my relevant details the westin bot can actually leave the</p>
      <p begin="01:47:31.330" end="01:47:31.830">conversation.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:33.250" end="01:47:37.140">Now we're seeing a third aspect of cortana she knows my</p>
      <p begin="01:47:37.140" end="01:47:39.870">connections she knows who I communicate with</p>
      <p begin="01:47:39.870" end="01:47:44.850">so here you're seeing her actually suggest that when I go on this trip to dublin that I communicate with</p>
      <p begin="01:47:44.850" end="01:47:49.490">my friend jani and I see this card I could call her directly from here</p>
      <p begin="01:47:49.490" end="01:47:55.050">are video call her but I don't know what time it is so I'm going to choose to message her clicking that</p>
      <p begin="01:47:55.050" end="01:48:00.050">takes me to the conversation I have with jani the other thing you'll notice is that cortana because she has</p>
      <p begin="01:48:00.050" end="01:48:04.900">context about why I m pinging jani she's prepopulated the text</p>
      <p begin="01:48:04.900" end="01:48:15.160">with context around when I'm going to dublin and basically why I want to talk to her.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:15.160" end="01:48:22.000">And, fantastic jani is available and she's even going to show me around tab.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:22.000" end="01:48:25.590">So, this is just a glimpse into how skype and cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:48:25.590" end="01:48:39.810">powered by bing can make our conversations more productive informed and fine.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:39.810" end="01:48:44.750">Now as you now real-time video is a big part of how skype is used today</p>
      <p begin="01:48:44.750" end="01:48:49.100">I just showed you intelligence applied to messaging conversations and I now have the</p>
      <p begin="01:48:49.100" end="01:48:55.230">pleasure of announcing we will also be bringing intelligence into real-time video.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:55.230" end="01:48:59.420">Skype video baths will reinvent the way that friends family</p>
      <p begin="01:48:59.420" end="01:49:05.330">and businesses get together for the first-time we will enable a very personalized</p>
      <p begin="01:49:05.330" end="01:49:12.660">experience for you to connect with your favorite character business or</p>
      <p begin="01:49:12.660" end="01:49:15.570">And, the best part is that starting today</p>
      <p begin="01:49:15.570" end="01:49:26.880">developers will have access to our first ever skype bot sdk.</p>
      <p begin="01:49:26.880" end="01:49:31.610">And, as you can see there you can also sign up to one of our global hackathons we're starting with the first one in</p>
      <p begin="01:49:31.610" end="01:49:36.090">may which is happening here down in silicon valley and you'll be able</p>
      <p begin="01:49:36.090" end="01:49:39.580">to seamlessly integrate into chats like I showed you or even</p>
      <p begin="01:49:39.580" end="01:49:47.180">invent totally new audio and video experiences for an audience of millions.</p>
      <p begin="01:49:47.180" end="01:49:52.040">to make this even sweeter for developers as of today skype consumers will</p>
      <p begin="01:49:52.040" end="01:50:03.570">have access to bots in our latest windows ios and android apps.</p>
      <p begin="01:50:03.570" end="01:50:08.020">But, this is just the beginning with hololens becoming available we</p>
      <p begin="01:50:08.020" end="01:50:12.100">are also bringing intelligence into your virtual conversations</p>
      <p begin="01:50:13.810" end="01:50:18.910">with skype for hololens please roll video.</p>
      <p begin="01:51:41.220" end="01:51:45.920">Now the new seen what these rich conversational canvases as well</p>
      <p begin="01:51:45.920" end="01:51:49.820">as personal digital assistants can do for you.</p>
      <p begin="01:51:49.820" end="01:51:54.690">developers we think that this represents a huge opportunity for you</p>
      <p begin="01:51:54.690" end="01:51:59.370">to write new types of applications we want</p>
      <p begin="01:51:59.370" end="01:52:05.090">to empower all developers to do this new work that</p>
      <p begin="01:52:05.090" end="01:52:10.010">means we want every developer to build.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:10.010" end="01:52:11.510">Experts for cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:12.740" end="01:52:16.610">We want every developer to be able to build.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:16.610" end="01:52:20.540">Bots as the new applications for every business</p>
      <p begin="01:52:20.540" end="01:52:26.480">and every service we want all developers to be able</p>
      <p begin="01:52:26.480" end="01:52:32.070">to infuse intelligence into their applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:32.070" end="01:52:35.830">to really make this possible we think of a new run-time.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:36.850" end="01:52:39.720">Which is this intelligence run time?</p>
      <p begin="01:52:39.720" end="01:52:45.420">That's all coming together as part of cortana intelligence suite.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:45.420" end="01:52:47.400">The runs on azure.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:47.400" end="01:52:49.880">That's going to have a rich bot</p>
      <p begin="01:52:49.880" end="01:52:54.490">framework a bot framework that will allow you to build.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:54.490" end="01:53:00.430">Rich dialogue capability into your application into your bot.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:00.430" end="01:53:04.980">A bot framework that will allow you not just to build bots for any one</p>
      <p begin="01:53:04.980" end="01:53:05.910">canvas</p>

      <p begin="01:53:12.560" end="01:53:17.810">So, you will be able to take the bot framework and in fact integrate with all of</p>
      <p begin="01:53:17.810" end="01:53:24.720">slack skype line outlook all of the canvases.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:24.720" end="01:53:27.540">We also want to give you a set of micro</p>

      <p begin="01:53:41.040" end="01:53:45.030">of this intelligence run time and cortana intelligence</p>
      <p begin="01:53:45.030" end="01:53:51.190">suite is going to be core just like how the dot net run times were.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:51.190" end="01:53:54.390">To all the applications that you're going to build going forward.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:55.570" end="01:54:00.400">And, to give you a glimpse of this world and what cortana intelligence suite</p>

      <p begin="01:54:09.810" end="01:54:16.950">and micro services dan first new thanks satya?</p>
      <p begin="01:54:16.950" end="01:54:20.880">In today's demos of windows cortana and skype we've shown you how</p>
      <p begin="01:54:20.880" end="01:54:24.520">microsoft is creating new conversational experiences if</p>
      <p begin="01:54:24.520" end="01:54:27.500">you're developer or business professional you may want to add</p>
      <p begin="01:54:27.500" end="01:54:32.200">bots and conversations your own products and we want to share our services and open</p>
      <p begin="01:54:32.200" end="01:54:36.300">source our tools so you can use them to build your own great bots.</p>
      <p begin="01:54:36.300" end="01:54:39.270">So, today I m so excited to introduce a brand-new</p>
      <p begin="01:54:39.270" end="01:54:49.160">platform for creating intelligent and connected bots the microsoft bot framework.</p>
      <p begin="01:54:49.160" end="01:54:54.110">What are you're building a simple tick-tack-toe bot creating a productivity bot to make your business smarter</p>
      <p begin="01:54:54.110" end="01:54:58.990">or faster or adding conversation to an existing brand like you saw with the westin bot the</p>
      <p begin="01:54:58.990" end="01:55:03.410">microsoft bot framework has everything you need to get your bot stocking?</p>
      <p begin="01:55:03.410" end="01:55:06.320">Let me give you an introduction.</p>
      <p begin="01:55:06.320" end="01:55:10.450">If you've already got a bot the microsoft bot framework can seamlessly connect that bots</p>
      <p begin="01:55:10.450" end="01:55:16.910">as users on skype slack telegram sms email and more.</p>
      <p begin="01:55:16.910" end="01:55:18.080">Don't have a bot</p>
      <p begin="01:55:18.080" end="01:55:22.890">our open source bot builder sdk available on github has everything you need to give your</p>
      <p begin="01:55:22.890" end="01:55:27.820">node dot js or csharp based bot great dialoging conversation skills</p>
      <p begin="01:55:27.820" end="01:55:33.410">and also makes it easy to integrate natural language processing and machine learning services coming</p>
      <p begin="01:55:33.410" end="01:55:38.380">soon our bot directory will contain many fantastic bots written using the bot framework</p>
      <p begin="01:55:38.380" end="01:55:43.010">including the build bot which is available to give you information about the build event like session</p>
      <p begin="01:55:43.010" end="01:55:47.200">information nearby restaurants and more but</p>
      <p begin="01:55:47.200" end="01:55:51.810">I'm a developer and I'm really excited to show you how easy it is to write code using the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="01:55:51.810" end="01:55:56.700">bot framework to show you what it's like I put together a simple bot that orders me pizza from</p>
      <p begin="01:55:56.700" end="01:56:03.820">domino's this is going to be great you're going to get to see some code and I get order myself lunch?</p>
      <p begin="01:56:03.820" end="01:56:06.710">Here's the source code for my bot when a user sends my</p>
      <p begin="01:56:06.710" end="01:56:11.130">bottom message the bot framework calls into this method right here and if user said</p>
      <p begin="01:56:11.130" end="01:56:15.810">slashed order we drop into this block of code were first I put together my pizza</p>
      <p begin="01:56:15.810" end="01:56:20.600">medium hand-tossed with spinach and mushrooms then I put that pizza into an order of</p>
      <p begin="01:56:20.600" end="01:56:27.580">specified the delivery address and the credit card that I found.</p>
      <p begin="01:56:27.580" end="01:56:32.020">That's a satya assures me use buying and then I place the order to</p>
      <p begin="01:56:32.020" end="01:56:36.660">dominoes secure rest api now since I'm dealing with a credit card I don't</p>
      <p begin="01:56:36.660" end="01:56:39.660">want don't transmit that and plain-text so I want to make sure</p>
      <p begin="01:56:39.660" end="01:56:44.180">that's commit sent securely over secure channel</p>
      <p begin="01:56:44.180" end="01:56:49.720">tryout our bot I'm going to show you my bots webpage in our bot directory.</p>
      <p begin="01:56:49.720" end="01:56:53.060">Now it can be really hard to try out new bots so as part of the bot framework</p>
      <p begin="01:56:53.060" end="01:56:56.770">we've included a reusable and secure will chat control that developers can</p>
      <p begin="01:56:56.770" end="01:57:00.340">put in their own webpages so customers can talk directly with their bots.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:00.340" end="01:57:05.160">Straight out of say hi to my bot and a respond if I</p>
      <p begin="01:57:05.160" end="01:57:15.810">says such order will take just a second and there we go my orders on its way.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:15.810" end="01:57:19.400">This is great for simple bots but interesting bots need real dialogue</p>
      <p begin="01:57:19.400" end="01:57:23.640">and language skills that they can hold a real conversation I want my bot to be able to</p>
      <p begin="01:57:23.640" end="01:57:27.740">excepted an order from a real customer where they can specify the size of their pizza the</p>
      <p begin="01:57:27.740" end="01:57:32.150">toppings and more and you heard such talk about trustworthiness it's important for</p>
      <p begin="01:57:32.150" end="01:57:38.090">robot to get the users permission before actually sends the order on its way to dominoes now this is</p>
      <p begin="01:57:38.090" end="01:57:42.460">were a bot builder sdk really shines our bot builder sdk is available in node dot</p>
      <p begin="01:57:42.460" end="01:57:46.750">js and csharp but I'm writing in csharp so I'll show you that.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:46.750" end="01:57:51.570">Use our bot builder sdk I'm just going to remove the existing simple bot code</p>
      <p begin="01:57:51.570" end="01:57:54.640">that I've got an ad in a couple of lines here.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:55.650" end="01:57:58.130">And, then up at the top of configured the bot builder</p>
      <p begin="01:57:58.130" end="01:58:03.450">sdk so, the my bot talks the way I want to I've added welcome message a</p>
      <p begin="01:58:03.450" end="01:58:08.380">confirmation prompt and then actually added in the code place the order</p>
      <p begin="01:58:08.380" end="01:58:12.530">the bot builder sdk does all the work of walking my user through filling in my</p>
      <p begin="01:58:12.530" end="01:58:16.160">up the object that represents my pizza which are defined as a</p>
      <p begin="01:58:16.160" end="01:58:22.440">plain csharp object with a few annotations now next we're going to actually connect my</p>
      <p begin="01:58:22.440" end="01:58:26.110">bot to users so I'm going to go to my bots dashboard in the developed</p>
      <p begin="01:58:26.110" end="01:58:30.460">in our developer portal in the bot framework a you can see here it's</p>
      <p begin="01:58:30.460" end="01:58:35.310">easy to connect my bot up to services like skype slack telegram</p>
      <p begin="01:58:35.310" end="01:58:40.350">and others we bought the bot framework to be an open platform so we include many third-party</p>
      <p begin="01:58:40.350" end="01:58:45.350">services including pervasive services like sms which are accessible worldwide</p>
      <p begin="01:58:45.350" end="01:58:54.330">and available even on inexpensive devices like this fourteen dollar mobile phone.</p>
      <p begin="01:58:54.330" end="01:58:59.250">Now we're really excited to introduce the bot framework or even more excited to see the kinds of things</p>
      <p begin="01:58:59.250" end="01:59:02.590">you write using it we have a session coming up immediately after the keynote at</p>
      <p begin="01:59:02.590" end="01:59:07.350">eleven thirty were walk you through the process of building a conversational bot from zero to sixty</p>
      <p begin="01:59:07.350" end="01:59:12.330">using the bot framework hope to see there are up next I like to introduce lili tang</p>
      <p begin="01:59:12.330" end="01:59:24.910">is going to give you a sneak peek at some upcoming intelligent tools coming to the bot framework in the future.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:24.910" end="01:59:27.080">So, as dan said I'm going to give you a sneak</p>
      <p begin="01:59:27.080" end="01:59:36.140">peek at some tools we the experimenting with to help you build your bot sprayed.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:36.140" end="01:59:37.990">All right so here I have</p>
      <p begin="01:59:37.990" end="01:59:45.280">my chat control and I can type in please send me a large pepperoni pizza.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:45.280" end="01:59:49.500">And, you can see that my bot understands the size and toppings</p>
      <p begin="01:59:49.500" end="01:59:52.560">ask me to clarify what kind of crust I want.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:52.560" end="01:59:55.960">Now in order to do this your bot needs to understand natural</p>
      <p begin="01:59:55.960" end="02:00:00.900">language so as you begin before you have real users using your bot</p>
      <p begin="02:00:00.900" end="02:00:03.770">the before you have real user response data we</p>
      <p begin="02:00:03.770" end="02:00:13.690">provided some simple tools to help you build your natural language rules let's take a look.</p>
      <p begin="02:00:13.690" end="02:00:15.890">All right so these are the rules behind my bot</p>
      <p begin="02:00:15.890" end="02:00:20.750">brain just like dan showed you except we providing you why</p>
      <p begin="02:00:20.750" end="02:00:25.550">do make them a little bit easier to read so if you look at the first rule it</p>
      <p begin="02:00:25.550" end="02:00:30.500">matches responses such as deliver me some quantity of</p>
      <p begin="02:00:30.500" end="02:00:41.210">some size pizza a with some kind of topping that's pretty cool right.</p>
      <p begin="02:00:41.210" end="02:00:45.650">So, I can just click into the deliver blurb to understand it more and here you</p>
      <p begin="02:00:45.650" end="02:00:50.580">can see that not only the word deliver triggers the verb but also order and</p>
      <p begin="02:00:50.580" end="02:00:53.680">by so that's pretty cool too.</p>
      <p begin="02:00:53.680" end="02:00:57.960">But, what if people use other words?</p>
      <p begin="02:00:57.960" end="02:01:02.870">Because we mine the web and understand language things like verb</p>
      <p begin="02:01:02.870" end="02:01:07.740">tense translation into other language common misspellings we can help</p>
      <p begin="02:01:07.740" end="02:01:11.330">you by providing you some suggestions for synonyms.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:11.330" end="02:01:14.790">All you need to do is click.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:14.790" end="02:01:19.980">Select once you once.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:19.980" end="02:01:28.450">And, you expanded dictionary really easy.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:28.450" end="02:01:33.030">What else is great is if I have other bots like the cupcake bot that lilian</p>
      <p begin="02:01:33.030" end="02:01:39.250">showed you earlier I can share these dictionaries across my various bots?</p>
      <p begin="02:01:39.250" end="02:01:43.710">Now rules are great and critical for getting started but as you</p>
      <p begin="02:01:43.710" end="02:01:48.240">start getting more and more users and more and more response data rules can</p>
      <p begin="02:01:48.240" end="02:01:55.370">be very complex to manage and this is where we provide you with another tool.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:55.370" end="02:01:58.220">Here we use machine learning</p>
      <p begin="02:01:58.220" end="02:02:02.440">and deep learning to create your conversation model.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:02.440" end="02:02:06.890">So, building upon what I just showed you we automatically add</p>
      <p begin="02:02:06.890" end="02:02:11.700">your semantic dictionary and your rules we also make it really easy for you to upload</p>
      <p begin="02:02:11.700" end="02:02:16.570">additional training data to get started now we know.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:17.620" end="02:02:21.260">That people can be very unpredictable as they user bots.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:22.400" end="02:02:24.190">So, here you can see a</p>
      <p begin="02:02:24.190" end="02:02:31.380">user has said can you deliver three large pepperoni pizzas to my crib.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:31.380" end="02:02:36.130">So, you're laughing so, you know, and, I know that my crib is slang for</p>
      <p begin="02:02:36.130" end="02:02:40.660">house but the system doesn't know that so it's really easy for me if I</p>
      <p begin="02:02:40.660" end="02:02:46.320">think it's appropriate to tag it as a location and</p>
      <p begin="02:02:46.320" end="02:02:51.910">save so it's that easy to help teach your bot and help</p>
      <p begin="02:02:51.910" end="02:02:56.170">become smarter and you don't need to be a data science expert in</p>
      <p begin="02:02:56.170" end="02:02:59.990">fact you don't even really need to know how to code to help your bot improve.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:01.160" end="02:03:07.810">So, that's pretty cool right.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:07.810" end="02:03:10.320">All right so finally we</p>
      <p begin="02:03:10.320" end="02:03:15.160">know intelligent systems have their limitations so here I take send me</p>
      <p begin="02:03:15.160" end="02:03:23.090">a large pepperoni pizza a to moscone a that too.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:23.090" end="02:03:26.920">Eric and here my body's telling me I don't understand.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:28.050" end="02:03:31.510">And, what it can do for tasks that are rare complex?</p>
      <p begin="02:03:34.230" end="02:03:38.180">Or just that it doesn't understand it can automatically escalate</p>
      <p begin="02:03:38.180" end="02:03:42.410">to a person and this is something that we think is a great example of</p>
      <p begin="02:03:42.410" end="02:03:45.780">what satya mentioned earlier to combine what people do</p>
      <p begin="02:03:45.780" end="02:03:55.240">best with the intelligent system so let's take a look at what the worker might see.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:55.240" end="02:03:58.530">All right so here as I'm working</p>
      <p begin="02:03:58.530" end="02:04:03.260">the system in real time is automatically suggesting me responses and you can</p>
      <p begin="02:04:03.260" end="02:04:07.950">see those responses below my text entry in the chat window.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:07.950" end="02:04:10.230">And, then on the side the system</p>
      <p begin="02:04:10.230" end="02:04:15.120">is automatically pre-filling my order form based on what it knows.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:15.120" end="02:04:19.740">Now I can see here the system has incorrectly</p>
      <p begin="02:04:19.740" end="02:04:26.820">classified moscone is a person so all I need to do it again is click.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:26.820" end="02:04:30.570">Correct the annotation and save it.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:30.570" end="02:04:33.970">The system prompts me to clarify that its moscone</p>
      <p begin="02:04:33.970" end="02:04:38.630">center and again my suggested response is update I can just click</p>
      <p begin="02:04:38.630" end="02:04:50.580">and enter to have to facilitate my interaction with my customer.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:50.580" end="02:04:53.240">So, this is exciting because while working I can</p>
      <p begin="02:04:53.240" end="02:04:56.950">continue to teach my bot without needing to know</p>
      <p begin="02:04:56.950" end="02:05:03.300">natural language machine learning deep learning or even coding.</p>

      <p begin="02:05:06.610" end="02:05:09.900">the intelligent system can help me get my work done more effectively</p>
      <p begin="02:05:11.150" end="02:05:15.790">that's it for my sneak peek we know we have a lot to learn.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:15.790" end="02:05:27.010">As we continue to experiment and make we will make these tools more broadly available.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:27.010" end="02:05:31.330">And, of course as you've already heard you can get started today with both</p>
      <p begin="02:05:31.330" end="02:05:35.420">the bot framework that dan showed you earlier to build and connect your bot</p>
      <p begin="02:05:35.420" end="02:05:37.250">to places people connect</p>
      <p begin="02:05:37.250" end="02:05:41.480">skype bot tools and also cornelia is up next to show you the</p>
      <p begin="02:05:41.480" end="02:05:48.400">new cognitive services which will help make your tools more intelligent thank you.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:48.400" end="02:05:51.320">Thank you lili.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:51.320" end="02:05:53.770">Ria hello everybody in a</p>
      <p begin="02:05:53.770" end="02:05:58.380">year ago we introduced the first portfolio of intelligent services</p>
      <p begin="02:05:58.380" end="02:06:02.810">from microsoft we had five apis for you to go use</p>
      <p begin="02:06:02.810" end="02:06:05.810">and add intelligence to your apps.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:05.810" end="02:06:10.370">Well, today I want to introduce you to microsoft dot com slash cognitive</p>
      <p begin="02:06:10.370" end="02:06:15.070">our new portfolio of intelligent services and we have twenty-two</p>
      <p begin="02:06:15.070" end="02:06:19.590">apis for you to get started with for free today.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:19.590" end="02:06:22.860">We have apis we have apis</p>
      <p begin="02:06:22.860" end="02:06:28.960">across vision from image to video understanding speech.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:28.960" end="02:06:30.560">Language understanding apis.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:31.790" end="02:06:32.820">Knowledge apis.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:33.830" end="02:06:37.560">And, of course search apis through bing</p>
      <p begin="02:06:37.560" end="02:06:41.970">twenty-two apis for you to get started with this is years</p>
      <p begin="02:06:41.970" end="02:06:46.610">of machine learning and ai research from microsoft ready for you to use</p>
      <p begin="02:06:46.610" end="02:06:54.140">at your fingertips now you can just samoa.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:54.140" end="02:06:58.420">You can just imagine all the cool stuff you can build with these apis and to showcase what's</p>
      <p begin="02:06:58.420" end="02:07:02.650">possible I'm going to show you a handful of demos the first</p>
      <p begin="02:07:02.650" end="02:07:07.470">I'll show you is a quick app we put together all I need to do in</p>
      <p begin="02:07:07.470" end="02:07:12.160">this app is either take a photo or upload some image url logistic</p>
      <p begin="02:07:12.160" end="02:07:16.980">this desk here and use that it calls into the new vision apis and</p>
      <p begin="02:07:16.980" end="02:07:26.990">what that is able to do is able to recognize objects in the image?</p>
      <p begin="02:07:26.990" end="02:07:31.690">There are thousands of objects we can recognize and we also give you a confidence score if</p>
      <p begin="02:07:31.690" end="02:07:36.690">the confidence is low, you know, we're not quite sure if for seeing what we say we're seeing if the</p>
      <p begin="02:07:36.690" end="02:07:41.680">confidence is high you can probably take it for real.</p>
      <p begin="02:07:41.680" end="02:07:46.760">Now it's cool we have object recognition we can take it a step further and role show you</p>
      <p begin="02:07:46.760" end="02:07:52.250">in my next demo we can take it a step further by not just recognizing objects but also figuring</p>
      <p begin="02:07:52.250" end="02:07:56.940">out the relationships behind them and then using natural language to create</p>
      <p begin="02:07:56.940" end="02:08:00.440">a coherent description of what you're seeing in the image.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:01.480" end="02:08:05.450">This is caption bot that ai and you them aware side we're going to allow you to</p>
      <p begin="02:08:05.450" end="02:08:09.920">play with today I went in earlier picked up a couple of random images</p>
      <p begin="02:08:09.920" end="02:08:15.520">off of bing and now let's see what our little caption bot signal to say</p>
      <p begin="02:08:15.520" end="02:08:20.090">its thinks it's a herd of cattle standing on a dry grass field I love the fact</p>
      <p begin="02:08:20.090" end="02:08:24.560">that it gives the vocabulary right that doesn't say group of cattle or group of animals no it's a</p>
      <p begin="02:08:24.560" end="02:08:31.690">herd of cattle and it also sees that it's a dry grass field.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:31.690" end="02:08:36.350">This is the mona lisa as most of you here now let's see what.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:36.350" end="02:08:41.350">Our little caption bot can do.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:41.350" end="02:08:46.160">All right so trips of its as I'm not really confident but I think if we have a heart</p>
      <p begin="02:08:46.160" end="02:08:52.580">of the vinci sitting in front of the mirror and he seems neutral faced.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:52.580" end="02:08:57.110">This goes to show you our bot wasn't taught any art so then it doesn't</p>
      <p begin="02:08:57.110" end="02:09:01.850">recognize the masters of the renaissance of their masterpieces we haven't</p>
      <p begin="02:09:01.850" end="02:09:06.780">shown it any of that data we've only shown it landscapes and gatherings and,</p>
      <p begin="02:09:06.780" end="02:09:10.830">you know, your average day-to-day life to learn from.</p>
      <p begin="02:09:10.830" end="02:09:15.610">And, I showed you this example to show just how important data is when you are</p>
      <p begin="02:09:15.610" end="02:09:20.820">trying to take advantage of these machine learning a services an apis and</p>
      <p begin="02:09:20.820" end="02:09:25.200">we're working on allowing you to bring your own data to these algorithms</p>
      <p begin="02:09:25.200" end="02:09:29.240">and customize them for your needs.</p>
      <p begin="02:09:29.240" end="02:09:32.630">Which frankly into my third demo?</p>
      <p begin="02:09:32.630" end="02:09:38.390">This demo is a quick little app that we put together to show you a service we call</p>
      <p begin="02:09:38.390" end="02:09:43.080">Custom recognition intelligent service it allows you to bring any audio</p>
      <p begin="02:09:43.080" end="02:09:47.860">files and customize our speech-to-text technology that's already shipped in</p>
      <p begin="02:09:47.860" end="02:09:51.890">products like cortana and bing so if your scenario</p>
      <p begin="02:09:51.890" end="02:09:56.400">calls for audio that has a lot of background noise think of,</p>
      <p begin="02:09:56.400" end="02:10:01.220">you know, a busy drive-through and you're trying to understand what you're customers ordering or think, you</p>
      <p begin="02:10:01.220" end="02:10:06.140">know, you're trying to understand what people with heavy romanian accents like me are trying to say</p>
      <p begin="02:10:06.140" end="02:10:11.090">well you bring those files and you're able to train the speech-to-text algorithms</p>
      <p begin="02:10:11.090" end="02:10:17.450">to have higher precision for your scenarios what I'm showing you here is an example that we</p>
      <p begin="02:10:17.450" end="02:10:21.820">trained with child speech and I hope the audio is hooked up because it's important to realize</p>
      <p begin="02:10:21.820" end="02:10:26.710">just how bad the audio can be here and the difference between speech regular speech-to-text versus</p>
      <p begin="02:10:26.710" end="02:10:31.950">cris left side shows you regular speech-to-text right side is</p>
      <p begin="02:10:31.950" end="02:10:38.080">cris and now let's see what our system is able to recognize.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:38.080" end="02:10:40.850">Chance like large bash.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:40.850" end="02:10:46.940">They use case badge collects star.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:46.940" end="02:10:52.490">We had some kids here read a book about giants and you can clearly see that cris gets</p>
      <p begin="02:10:52.490" end="02:10:58.520">kids not talking about dancing is talking about giants and the fact that they love large bags.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:58.520" end="02:10:59.020">No.</p>
      <p begin="02:11:01.360" end="02:11:04.970">Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="02:11:04.970" end="02:11:09.720">Now these demos are all fun I'm going to finish up by showing showing you a real</p>
      <p begin="02:11:09.720" end="02:11:13.220">customer scenario witti globe is a</p>
      <p begin="02:11:13.220" end="02:11:17.190">startup and they do real-time twitter analysis</p>
      <p begin="02:11:17.190" end="02:11:22.080">monitoring they try to create a twitter analysis for anything from</p>
      <p begin="02:11:22.080" end="02:11:26.660">brands to politics and I went in earlier and use the</p>
      <p begin="02:11:26.660" end="02:11:31.310">products the dashboard that they offer their customers to actually create a dashboard for</p>
      <p begin="02:11:31.310" end="02:11:35.550">the current presidential elections you can see them move</p>
      <p begin="02:11:35.550" end="02:11:40.550">the entire election and this and this little blurb here the cool thing of a visual with that</p>
      <p begin="02:11:40.550" end="02:11:45.940">it doesn't just give you these mood indicators it also offers extra of our context</p>
      <p begin="02:11:45.940" end="02:11:50.950">like the gender of the people who tweet or their age ranges and,</p>
      <p begin="02:11:50.950" end="02:11:55.700">creating these gender and age range indicators they actually use the vision apis</p>
      <p begin="02:11:55.700" end="02:12:01.110">from cognitive services they use the vision apis to look at the profile image and add extra</p>
      <p begin="02:12:01.110" end="02:12:06.100">precision to the age or the gender identification are they further</p>
      <p begin="02:12:06.100" end="02:12:10.860">use cognitive services also filter out any kind of tweets or content</p>
      <p begin="02:12:10.860" end="02:12:15.670">that are just irrelevant to the dashboards they are trying to create.</p>
      <p begin="02:12:15.670" end="02:12:21.150">Now just like vidigrove who is one of the partners who has started testing our apis early on</p>
      <p begin="02:12:21.150" end="02:12:24.640">you can go to microsoft dot com slash cognitive</p>
      <p begin="02:12:24.640" end="02:12:28.390">today and get started for free we can't wait to see the</p>
      <p begin="02:12:28.390" end="02:12:38.930">stuff you build with these cool apis thank you.</p>
      <p begin="02:12:38.930" end="02:12:41.640">Thank you so much cornelia so hopefully you get</p>

      <p begin="02:12:48.010" end="02:12:50.150">And, now it is up to each of</p>
      <p begin="02:12:50.150" end="02:12:53.210">faucets developers to imagine</p>
