      <p begin="00:01:11.660" end="00:01:16.090">with microsoft developer conferences in fact when I think about even the but</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.090" end="00:01:20.500">the might children I think about the various platform eras at microsoft</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.500" end="00:01:23.360">all my son belongs to ys</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:27.670">and my daughters are all dot net and it's so it's so</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.670" end="00:01:32.420">fantastic to be back here and talking to developers there's one thing</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.420" end="00:01:37.860">that's so unique about developer conferences developers</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:41.970">come here excited already about technology they get to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:46.670">see more technology meet more people who are talking technology</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:49.800">most importantly they walk away inspired.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.930">By what they see they learn to build even more</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.930" end="00:02:00.090">cooler technology that uniqueness of developer conferences</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:04.150">is what we want to celebrate here over the next three days</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.150" end="00:02:08.920">that ability of developers to amplify technology is what we want</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.920" end="00:02:14.070">to talk about a over the course of this conference at build.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.070" end="00:02:18.540">Talking about all of this technology.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:23.860">In fact there is a much more mainstream dialogue.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.860" end="00:02:25.460">About the role of technology.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.870" end="00:02:29.310">In our society.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.310" end="00:02:33.900">And, it's the right time to have that dialogue because technologies so much more</p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:37.360">mainstream it's embedded in our daily lives</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.170">it's embedded in our companies in our industries in our economies</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:45.100">and countries much more so than ever before.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:48.860">So, we have these.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.860" end="00:02:53.680">Profound questions and issues in front of us.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:58.370">technology driving economic growth for everyone?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.510" end="00:03:03.540">Or is economic growth stalled in spite?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:09.080">Of technological spend.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.080" end="00:03:15.100">Is technology empowering people or is it displacing us?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.100" end="00:03:20.020">Is technology helping us preserve our enduring values such as</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.020" end="00:03:21.330">privacy?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.330" end="00:03:24.920">Or is it compromising it?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.920" end="00:03:28.230">These are the issues that are being discussed and their the</p>
      <p begin="00:03:28.230" end="00:03:32.940">right issues for us to have a broad dialogue not just in one</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.940" end="00:03:39.940">company not just in one of our industry but as a society.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.940" end="00:03:41.330">I m a optimist.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.820" end="00:03:44.780">We as a company.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.780" end="00:03:48.420">Are optimistic about what technology can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:48.420" end="00:03:52.970">do for us I believe technology can</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:57.090">in fact drive economic growth all over the world?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:02.790">I believe technology can empower us.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:09.030">I believe technology can be used to preserve our enduring values.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.030" end="00:04:13.000">We do however have to make choices how we go about building</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.000" end="00:04:13.500">technology.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.570" end="00:04:17.890">We need to make design choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.890" end="00:04:22.140">Economic choices and social choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:23.840">That ensure.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:28.160">That the way we build technology the way we use technology helps</p>
      <p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:34.130">us make progress as a society that optimism.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.260" end="00:04:38.800">And, that several choices is embedded</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.500">encoded in our mission to empower every person</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:47.970">and every organization on the planet to achieve more.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.970" end="00:04:51.150">want to make things so that others.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.640" end="00:04:56.020">Can make things and make things happen?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:00.690">That is our broad platform approach.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:04.350">And, when we think about driving success?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.350" end="00:05:08.140">And, empowering people and businesses through digital</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.140" end="00:05:08.640">technology.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:14.180">We have to start with all of you as developers we have</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.180" end="00:05:17.610">to empower you with technology but more importantly we have to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:17.610" end="00:05:21.940">create that opportunity for you to be able to express your</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.940" end="00:05:22.440">creativity.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.690" end="00:05:29.590">That can change the world and throughout this developer conference that's what we want to talk</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.590" end="00:05:32.160">about the platforms that</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:36.070">you get to work on that really.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.070" end="00:05:41.720">Are going to help you change the world?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.720" end="00:05:44.430">We live in a mobile-first cloud-first world we've talked</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.430" end="00:05:50.810">about this many times before but it's always good to go back to make sure.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.810" end="00:05:54.050">That we are grounded in what we mean by mobile-first cloud-first.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.200" end="00:05:59.620">For us mobile first is not about the mobility of any single device</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:04.290">it is the mobility of the human experience across all the devices</p>
      <p begin="00:06:04.290" end="00:06:08.630">that all the computing in our lives.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.630" end="00:06:10.790">Cloud is not a single destination.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:12.270" end="00:06:14.520">Cloud is a new form of computing.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:20.520">That in fact enables that mobility of experience across all our devices</p>
      <p begin="00:06:20.520" end="00:06:25.480">it infuses those experiences with intelligence because it has the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.480" end="00:06:29.960">ability to reason over large amounts of data using a distributed computing</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.960" end="00:06:37.630">fabric that's what is the rich mobile-first cloud-first world for which we are building.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:37.630" end="00:06:44.310">And, we are building three interconnected platforms.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.310" end="00:06:44.880">To morrow</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:51.740">you want to hear from struck got three about our intelligent cloud and azure.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:51.740" end="00:06:54.220">Scott's going to talk about extensively</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.220" end="00:06:58.180">how for all of the new application patterns starting with</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.180" end="00:07:04.400">iot ttwo mobile to web to machine learning how</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:08.630">you can use data and infrastructure to build these</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08.630" end="00:07:13.470">applications more importantly he's going to talk about how.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.470" end="00:07:13.990">Building</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.990" end="00:07:18.610">more azure gives you the opportunity to reach over five</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.610" end="00:07:25.320">million businesses that are already in azure active directory.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:30.300">Qi lu is going to talk tomorrow about the opportunity with office</p>
      <p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:31.990">three-six five.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.990" end="00:07:36.540">We're opening up office three-six five unlike ever before your</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36.540" end="00:07:40.170">applications your data to office three-six five connectors.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.380" end="00:07:43.440">And, add-ins can be found within</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:48.830">the ui scaffolding of office very naturally by the users of office.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.830" end="00:07:51.560">That is one-point-two billion users of office</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.560" end="00:07:56.480">ultimately will be able to get access to all of your applications because they get</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.480" end="00:08:01.230">built-in to the ui scaffolding we also want to take the rich</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01.230" end="00:08:06.190">semantic information underneath office that is people their relationships</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.190" end="00:08:10.160">this schedules their files and all the other artifacts</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:14.920">and expose it as microsoft graph so that you can use it</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.920" end="00:08:18.070">you can extended as part of your applications</p>
      <p begin="00:08:18.070" end="00:08:22.590">so cheese want to talk about what that rich world looks like.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.590" end="00:08:23.490">And, this morning.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:24.530" end="00:08:30.350">Cherry and I will talk about more personal computing.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30.350" end="00:08:32.600">Windows ten is off.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33.840" end="00:08:35.880">To an amazing start.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:40.620">It's the fastest-growing version of windows both consumers and</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:42.960">enterprises.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:42.960" end="00:08:46.990">We have tremendous innovation in device.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.990" end="00:08:51.710">In fact it's new categories of windows devices whether they are iot</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51.710" end="00:09:00.340">t or hololens are getting created.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00.340" end="00:09:03.690">And, this morning you'll hear from terry in team</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.690" end="00:09:08.420">about all of the advances with windows how</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.420" end="00:09:12.980">we are bringing the natural user interface whether it be touch.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:16.110">Ink voice.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:20.940">Or even image recognition.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.940" end="00:09:27.980">So, that you can use them to build new categories of applications.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:30.580">We also want to talk about how.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.580" end="00:09:34.340">In gaming and consumptive applications we're going to open up</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34.340" end="00:09:41.250">both the pc and the consul for new opportunities for developers.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41.250" end="00:09:45.180">We also going to talk about how windows is your ultimate</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.180" end="00:09:49.940">dev box where you can do all your application development</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.940" end="00:09:58.110">for windows and beyond right there on a windows pc.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:58.110" end="00:10:04.040">We also want to talk about our new emerging platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.040" end="00:10:08.590">Where in a very early days of this it's actually the into section?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.590" end="00:10:15.770">Of all of our three ambitions recall it conversations as a platform.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.770" end="00:10:20.600">It's a simple concept yet it's very powerful its impact</p>
      <p begin="00:10:20.600" end="00:10:24.250">is about taking the our of human language.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:32.660">applying it more pervasively to all of our computing.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.660" end="00:10:36.170">That means we need to infuse into our computers and</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.170" end="00:10:43.240">computing intelligence, intelligence about us and our context.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:43.240" end="00:10:46.010">And, by doing so we think.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:50.270">This can have asked profound an impact as the previous platform shifts</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50.270" end="00:10:54.540">of had whether it be gui whether it be the web</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.540" end="00:10:57.480">are touch on mobile.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:57.480" end="00:11:03.500">So, we'll have extensive conversation about the beginning of this new platform journey but</p>
      <p begin="00:11:03.500" end="00:11:08.310">we want to get started with windows ten and what that opportunity</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.310" end="00:11:15.960">represents to all of you and do that let me please welcome terry myerson up on stage thank you?</p>

      <p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:27.140">tomorrow call mom but watch what happens when I write</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.140" end="00:21:31.990">tomorrow okay look first of all look how easy and smooth this ink is flowing but</p>
      <p begin="00:21:31.990" end="00:21:37.300">watch what happens next I wrote the word tomorrow because we're combining the our the pen and the pc you see it turn blue</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37.300" end="00:21:42.280">that's because we're smart enough to know that was handwriting to know that it was a day so if I touch it my homey who rocks</p>

      <p begin="00:46:13.880" end="00:46:18.290">So, here we're looking at the code for the real microsoft health app which is</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18.290" end="00:46:24.990">a companion app to the microsoft band you guys got bands out there absolutely awesome.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:24.990" end="00:46:27.730">So, microsoft band users have windows android and ios</p>
      <p begin="00:46:27.730" end="00:46:31.730">devices so the health team needs to have an app for all of them.</p>

      <p begin="00:46:39.130" end="00:46:43.450">the service connectivity because the health app was designed this way it was easy</p>
      <p begin="00:46:43.450" end="00:46:48.200">to use xamarin to take it to ios and android let me show you</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48.200" end="00:46:53.180">here the project so at the bottom here is one of the price I have this</p>
      <p begin="00:46:53.180" end="00:46:58.280">is the bulk of the code is all the shared code among all the different platforms</p>
      <p begin="00:46:58.280" end="00:47:03.280">he's a huge amount of code you really is like I said this is the actual health application format</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:09.180">shown code and left side admonish here that a lot of you want to show sometimes a real code?</p>

      <p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:18.480">heads one for universal apps they started with anyone for ios and one for android</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.330">the nice thing is with xamarin you can not only debug</p>

      <p begin="00:57:25.830" end="00:57:30.190">notifications like you just saw in this demo and kevin's demo earlier we</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.190" end="00:57:34.560">have consistent input support with controller and mouse and keyboard across all</p>
      <p begin="00:57:34.560" end="00:57:41.420">of our devices and distribution in the windows store or any other store.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:41.420" end="00:57:46.270">We've said from the start we want xbox one to be a great place for games</p>
      <p begin="00:57:46.270" end="00:57:51.180">and also a great place for developers of all sizes so you can create new games</p>
      <p begin="00:57:51.180" end="00:57:54.590">and application experiences today I</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.590" end="00:57:58.830">am pleased to announce xbox dev mode giving developers the</p>
      <p begin="00:57:58.830" end="00:58:05.530">ability to convert their retail xbox one into a development kit.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:05.530" end="00:58:10.400">Please welcome axes biker from our xbox platform team to show us how</p>
      <p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:15.390">thanks ashley we are building a truly universal platform where your apps run everywhere</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15.390" end="00:58:20.220">including the xbox one which provides a huge opportunity for app developers to bring</p>
      <p begin="00:58:20.220" end="00:58:25.170">their experiences to life in the living room so now I'm going to show you how anyone can take</p>
      <p begin="00:58:25.170" end="00:58:30.590">a retail xbox one and turn it into a dev kit.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:30.590" end="00:58:35.560">I was playing forts over here but I really want to do is work on my app ash photo which I'll show</p>
      <p begin="00:58:35.560" end="00:58:39.910">you in a minute but first I need to put my consul into dev mode.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39.910" end="00:58:40.920">So, go over here</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40.920" end="00:58:45.720">now run the dev mode activation app which I've already downloaded from the store.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:45.720" end="00:58:50.140">This app allows you to register your consul as a deb consul which I've already done using my</p>
      <p begin="00:58:50.140" end="00:58:53.620">same account in dead-center where I submit all my other uw</p>
      <p begin="00:58:53.620" end="00:59:00.570">p applications this means that I can switch to dev mode with a single button press.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00.570" end="00:59:04.830">Once the xbox is finished rebooting it will be in dev mode which means I can</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.830" end="00:59:09.040">deploy and debug my app now while attributing let's go over here to</p>
      <p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:15.030">the pc and look at asch photo running on the pc where I'm actually writing.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.030" end="00:59:19.130">So, you can see how the ui elements move and adjust as a change the size of</p>
      <p begin="00:59:19.130" end="00:59:25.370">the window and now let's see how we can deploy this theme app to the xbox one</p>
      <p begin="00:59:25.370" end="00:59:28.450">so I'll stop debugging over here on the pc and I'll switch</p>
      <p begin="00:59:28.450" end="00:59:33.610">local machine to remote machine this is the ip address of my xbox.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:33.610" end="00:59:35.430">And, then the signal.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35.430" end="00:59:40.360">And, since I've already paired visual studio with my xbox I can do a remote deploy just like</p>
      <p begin="00:59:40.360" end="00:59:44.280">any other universal windows device.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:50.010" end="00:59:55.010">Right so that's my consul in years my app running on my xbox one so,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:55.010" end="00:59:59.240">this is the exact same code that we were just debugging over here but now that</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.240" end="01:00:03.490">it's on the consul you can tell that it's been optimized for the living room.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:03.490" end="01:00:07.470">Good news is that the universal windows platform did a lot of the heavy lifting,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:07.470" end="01:00:10.580">for example, the controller just works</p>
      <p begin="01:00:10.580" end="01:00:15.140">all xaml controls have already been optimized to work with the game bad just like you would</p>
      <p begin="01:00:15.140" end="01:00:20.060">expect including focus navigation and not just on xbox.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.060" end="01:00:24.630">Works the same way and the desktop when you have a controller plugged in fact all</p>
      <p begin="01:00:24.630" end="01:00:32.460">the xaml controls are designed to work great with touch mouse and controller.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:32.460" end="01:00:34.800">Helpful life.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:34.800" end="01:00:36.660">It also means that</p>
      <p begin="01:00:36.660" end="01:00:42.540">you can continue to test when you don't have your xbox look in your flight back home.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:42.540" end="01:00:46.690">Now since this is a universal windows application it also have access to the same</p>
      <p begin="01:00:46.690" end="01:00:51.400">universal apis including apis for speech recognition and synthesis so</p>
      <p begin="01:00:51.400" end="01:00:56.080">I've added a fun feature which allows me to add speech bubbles to my photos I can simply use</p>
      <p begin="01:00:56.080" end="01:01:00.520">the speech recognizer to fill them in which an xbox is way</p>
      <p begin="01:01:00.520" end="01:01:09.020">easier than typing so let me show you how this works will caption this photo right now.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:09.020" end="01:01:12.710">Lions bark right.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:12.710" end="01:01:15.710">Boom there we go.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:15.710" end="01:01:18.870">So, much easier than typing.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:18.870" end="01:01:22.420">Ok, I want to show you guys one more thing so in addition to the</p>
      <p begin="01:01:22.420" end="01:01:25.520">dev mode activation app I showed earlier there's another app</p>
      <p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:31.760">called dev home which will automatically get loaded on your consul once you've put it in dev mode.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.590">And, when you run it has everything you need is a developer from anything from account management to</p>
      <p begin="01:01:36.590" end="01:01:41.090">developer settings most importantly once I'm done working on my app</p>
      <p begin="01:01:41.090" end="01:01:44.810">for the night and I want to go back to playing forza I can just go ahead and</p>
      <p begin="01:01:44.810" end="01:01:49.200">press leave developer mode and back to retail mode?</p>
      <p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:57.710">I should mention that a preview of dev mode will be available starting today.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:57.710" end="01:01:58.570">Thanks ashley.</p>

      <p begin="01:11:54.340" end="01:11:58.120">And, today we and the cleveland clinic are constructing</p>
      <p begin="01:11:58.120" end="01:12:01.980">a state-of-the-future health education campus.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:01.980" end="01:12:06.000">Within this building our students will learn using the</p>

      <p begin="01:12:10.590" end="01:12:15.970">is a key part of this now last year we showed a few things that we thought</p>
      <p begin="01:12:15.970" end="01:12:18.250">might be possible with hololens.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:19.660" end="01:12:22.650">Since october we've had a small team of three</p>
      <p begin="01:12:22.650" end="01:12:26.320">computer programmers turning our ideas into reality.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:27.550" end="01:12:30.370">Today we're going to show you some of our work</p>
      <p begin="01:12:30.370" end="01:12:34.340">on our holographic anatomy program an example of the</p>
      <p begin="01:12:34.340" end="01:12:40.350">hours of curricular content that we have created now anatomy is all about</p>
      <p begin="01:12:40.350" end="01:12:45.090">mastering the complex systems in the body and you can see from the digestive</p>
      <p begin="01:12:45.090" end="01:12:49.730">system here that there are a lot of parts in a small space.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:49.730" end="01:12:54.090">And, students need to understand not only how these parts fit together but how</p>
      <p begin="01:12:54.090" end="01:12:58.990">they work together henry can you tell us which organ in the body</p>
      <p begin="01:12:58.990" end="01:13:03.060">aids in digestion and also makes insulin yes the</p>
      <p begin="01:13:03.060" end="01:13:07.200">be the pancreas to be a little hard to see it behind the stomach here</p>
      <p begin="01:13:07.200" end="01:13:13.370">but thankfully with hololens it's really easy to get the best view of things.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:13.370" end="01:13:17.860">Now another area that's difficult for our students to fully grasp is the nervous</p>
      <p begin="01:13:17.860" end="01:13:19.270">system.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:19.270" end="01:13:23.200">Hololens can make this much easier by improving</p>
      <p begin="01:13:23.200" end="01:13:26.550">our interactive learning beyond the single classroom.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:27.750" end="01:13:31.420">Professor mark griswold can teach us about the anatomy of</p>
      <p begin="01:13:31.420" end="01:13:36.710">the brain even though he's in cleveland let's show you how this works.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:36.710" end="01:13:40.430">Are you there mark?</p>
      <p begin="01:13:40.430" end="01:13:44.740">hi pam my everybody welcome to our new classroom.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:44.740" end="01:13:49.330">This is our new system that allows me to teach and interact with you even though I'm not there</p>
      <p begin="01:13:49.330" end="01:13:54.250">at build I'll tell you this feels really natural the three of us can see each</p>
      <p begin="01:13:54.250" end="01:13:58.650">other's were talking which makes us feel connected and even though you can only see my</p>
      <p begin="01:13:58.650" end="01:14:02.500">head and hand you get a sense of my body language this is</p>
      <p begin="01:14:02.500" end="01:14:08.440">really changing what it means to be in class mark let show them the white matter</p>
      <p begin="01:14:08.440" end="01:14:13.710">tracks these tracts act like super highways allowing</p>
      <p begin="01:14:13.710" end="01:14:19.440">messages to travel from one part of the brain to another this example comes from</p>
      <p begin="01:14:19.440" end="01:14:24.420">an mri scan of a real patient from the laboratory of professor</p>
      <p begin="01:14:24.420" end="01:14:29.170">cameron mcintyre at case western reserve university it's</p>
      <p begin="01:14:29.170" end="01:14:33.650">critical that our students know how these structures relate to one another I can tell you</p>
      <p begin="01:14:33.650" end="01:14:37.950">I've looked at datasets like this for over ten years and I never fully understood</p>
      <p begin="01:14:37.950" end="01:14:42.990">their three-d structure until I saw them in hololens let's say we have a patient with a brain</p>
      <p begin="01:14:42.990" end="01:14:47.740">tumor which are showing here with this red area hey jeff and henry.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:47.740" end="01:14:52.100">Can you see how this tumor intersects the light blue tract but not the green tract or</p>
      <p begin="01:14:52.100" end="01:14:55.650">the yellow one this allows us to predict the impact to this tumor on the</p>
      <p begin="01:14:55.650" end="01:15:00.320">patience symptoms and their outcomes after surgery?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:00.320" end="01:15:03.370">This could impact the occipital lobe back here.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:03.370" end="01:15:06.910">Which may harm the patient's vision might also influence the</p>
      <p begin="01:15:06.910" end="01:15:11.940">prior lobe here which would affect their sense of touch?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:11.940" end="01:15:14.540">The quicker our students learn facts like</p>
      <p begin="01:15:14.540" end="01:15:16.950">teas the more time they have to</p>
      <p begin="01:15:16.950" end="01:15:20.660">think with them we're teaching them to think like a doctor.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:21.830" end="01:15:23.910">Thanks mark for joining us today.</p>

      <p begin="01:22:48.290" end="01:22:52.240">We want to take that our of human language and as I said earlier</p>
      <p begin="01:22:52.240" end="01:22:57.150">apply it more pervasively to all of the computing interface and</p>
      <p begin="01:22:57.150" end="01:23:02.970">the computing interaction and to do that though you have to infuse.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:02.970" end="01:23:07.960">Into computers and computing around us intelligence that means you</p>
      <p begin="01:23:07.960" end="01:23:12.890">have to bring forth these technologies of artificial intelligence and machine</p>
      <p begin="01:23:12.890" end="01:23:17.670">learning so that we can teach computers to learn.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:17.670" end="01:23:22.860">Human language have conversational understanding teach them about</p>
      <p begin="01:23:22.860" end="01:23:27.020">the broad context people places things.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:27.020" end="01:23:31.790">Context about your preferences your personal knowledge.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:31.790" end="01:23:35.860">So, that they can really help you with your everyday tasks</p>
      <p begin="01:23:35.860" end="01:23:41.470">and everyday life both at work and elsewhere.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:41.470" end="01:23:42.960">So, as we infuse.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:44.690" end="01:23:45.490">Intelligence</p>
      <p begin="01:23:45.490" end="01:23:51.620">into everything I think it's very important to have a principled approach.</p>
      <p begin="01:23:51.620" end="01:23:56.220">a way to guide our design as well as how we build things?</p>
      <p begin="01:23:56.220" end="01:24:01.190">So, at microsoft we are focused on an approach that grounded in our</p>
      <p begin="01:24:01.190" end="01:24:06.090">mission to empower people and organizations all over the planet to achieve model</p>
      <p begin="01:24:06.090" end="01:24:11.670">the three core principles here first we want to build</p>
      <p begin="01:24:11.670" end="01:24:16.490">intelligence that augments human abilities and</p>
      <p begin="01:24:16.490" end="01:24:22.360">experiences ultimately it's not going to be about man versus machine</p>
      <p begin="01:24:22.360" end="01:24:26.260">is going to be about man with machines each of us</p>
      <p begin="01:24:26.260" end="01:24:29.310">excel a very different things.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:29.310" end="01:24:35.120">The fact that we have creativity empathy emotion.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:35.120" end="01:24:38.020">And, judgment.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:38.020" end="01:24:42.850">That can then be mixed with fast computation the ability to reason over large amounts of</p>
      <p begin="01:24:42.850" end="01:24:47.440">data and do pattern recognition fast it's that bringing together</p>
      <p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:53.190">that I think is going to help us move our society forward?</p>
      <p begin="01:24:53.190" end="01:24:57.420">We also have to build trust right into our technology that means.</p>
      <p begin="01:24:57.420" end="01:25:02.230">You have to have technology that has built-in protections for privacy</p>
      <p begin="01:25:02.230" end="01:25:08.770">east got transparency you have security as well as compliance.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:08.770" end="01:25:09.420">And, lastly.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:10.450" end="01:25:16.490">All technology that we build to be more inclusive and respectful</p>
      <p begin="01:25:16.490" end="01:25:22.620">we need to build technology so that more people can use technology.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:22.620" end="01:25:23.190">And, we want</p>
      <p begin="01:25:23.190" end="01:25:32.140">to build technology such that it gets the best of humanity not the worst.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:32.140" end="01:25:35.670">this is already guiding us as we build skype translate.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:36.680" end="01:25:41.580">To have conversational understanding as we build out cortana to have</p>
      <p begin="01:25:41.580" end="01:25:50.770">more expertise as we build hololens to have environmental understanding.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:50.770" end="01:25:54.040">Reuse this approach when we get it wrong in fact just last week when we</p>
      <p begin="01:25:54.040" end="01:25:58.700">launched our incubation tay which is a social bot in the united states</p>
      <p begin="01:25:58.700" end="01:26:03.440">we quickly realized that it was not up to this mark.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:03.440" end="01:26:06.640">So, we're back to the drawing board.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:06.640" end="01:26:10.680">Why we continue to incubate xiaoice and rina in</p>
      <p begin="01:26:10.680" end="01:26:17.640">china and japan and learn why is it that the social bots there'd work differently?</p>
      <p begin="01:26:17.640" end="01:26:21.930">And, that's how we want to make progress this approach is always going to be</p>
      <p begin="01:26:21.930" end="01:26:25.470">front-and-center to us.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:25.470" end="01:26:27.700">When we talk about conversations as a platform</p>
      <p begin="01:26:29.160" end="01:26:34.430">that reactors there's baths people?</p>
      <p begin="01:26:34.430" end="01:26:39.020">We want to be able to have the most natural conversations with other</p>
      <p begin="01:26:39.020" end="01:26:40.480">people.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:40.480" end="01:26:42.980">We want in fact to enrich our</p>
      <p begin="01:26:42.980" end="01:26:47.470">conversations and skype translate is a fantastic example of that because I'm able to</p>
      <p begin="01:26:47.470" end="01:26:51.420">talking to different languages and really have automatic translation</p>
      <p begin="01:26:52.570" end="01:26:57.040">we also have presence you saw in the holographic</p>
      <p begin="01:26:57.040" end="01:27:01.370">demo how you can have remote presence.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:01.370" end="01:27:07.950">These are all ways for us to enhance human conversations.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:07.950" end="01:27:14.990">But, we want to take that same our of human conversations and applied to everything</p>
      <p begin="01:27:14.990" end="01:27:18.370">And, that's where these other actors come in a personal digital</p>
      <p begin="01:27:18.370" end="01:27:23.350">assistant that knows you knows about your world is always with you</p>
      <p begin="01:27:23.350" end="01:27:29.170">across all your devices helping you with your everyday tasks.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:29.170" end="01:27:34.760">And, bots are like new applications that you converse with</p>
      <p begin="01:27:34.760" end="01:27:37.620">you're not really looking for multiple applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:39.180" end="01:27:43.350">Pages and pages a websites or apps but you just able</p>
      <p begin="01:27:43.350" end="01:27:50.870">to call on any application as a bot right within a conversational canvas.</p>
      <p begin="01:27:50.870" end="01:27:54.780">So, this is the rich world of conversations that we envision people-to-people</p>
      <p begin="01:27:55.790" end="01:28:01.280">people to your personal digital assistant people-to-bots and</p>
      <p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:06.230">even personal digital assistants calling on bots on your behalf.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:06.230" end="01:28:15.540">That's the world that you're going to get to see in the years to come.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:15.540" end="01:28:19.610">So, you can conceptualize this platform.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:19.610" end="01:28:20.800">Where human language?</p>
      <p begin="01:28:21.840" end="01:28:25.510">Is the new ui layer?</p>
      <p begin="01:28:25.510" end="01:28:29.830">Bots are like new applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:29.830" end="01:28:36.250">And, digital assistants are meta apps for like the new browsers.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:36.250" end="01:28:40.720">And, intelligence is infused into all of your interactions</p>
      <p begin="01:28:40.720" end="01:28:46.640">that's the rich platform that we have.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:46.640" end="01:28:47.430">So, let's start.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:48.570" end="01:28:51.490">By talking about cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:51.490" end="01:28:54.110">We introduced cortana two years ago and</p>
      <p begin="01:28:54.110" end="01:28:57.700">ever since then it's becoming smarter every day.</p>
      <p begin="01:28:58.750" end="01:29:01.950">Because of its ability to know you.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:02.960" end="01:29:06.800">To know about your organization to know about the world</p>
      <p begin="01:29:06.800" end="01:29:11.580">and reason about all of this on a continuous basis.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:11.580" end="01:29:14.580">It's built natively into windows.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:14.580" end="01:29:16.740">But, it's not limited to windows</p>
      <p begin="01:29:16.740" end="01:29:19.870">it's going to be available on all your devices</p>
      <p begin="01:29:19.870" end="01:29:23.140">whether ios android across all of your applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:24.520" end="01:29:29.370">Because if it's going to be a useful personal digital assistant it has to be about</p>
      <p begin="01:29:29.370" end="01:29:33.520">new not a single device and that's really</p>
      <p begin="01:29:33.520" end="01:29:41.480">how we are building out cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:29:41.480" end="01:29:46.140">And, we're also making it such that the expertise of cortana is</p>
      <p begin="01:29:46.140" end="01:29:52.150">extensible it's truly unbounded in that way so the opportunity</p>
      <p begin="01:29:52.150" end="01:29:56.720">for developers to addicts their expertise the expertise that they have</p>
      <p begin="01:29:56.720" end="01:30:01.010">in their applications this services into cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:30:01.010" end="01:30:05.150">so that can further drive engagement for their applications</p>
      <p begin="01:30:05.150" end="01:30:10.000">and services that developer opportunity is something that we want to talk about so to show</p>
      <p begin="01:30:10.000" end="01:30:14.930">you how this unbounded personal digital assistant works across</p>
      <p begin="01:30:14.930" end="01:30:19.450">all of your devices and creates this ability for developers to</p>
      <p begin="01:30:19.450" end="01:30:30.900">extended with your expertise please help me welcome markets ash from the cortana team.</p>
      <p begin="01:30:30.900" end="01:30:35.190">Good morning everyone it's great to be here at build to get a chance to give you an early preview of</p>
      <p begin="01:30:35.190" end="01:30:39.880">our future plans first I want to talk about a new experience the anniversary update</p>
      <p begin="01:30:39.880" end="01:30:44.540">we want windows to be the best place to have a voice conversation with cortana, cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:30:44.540" end="01:30:49.110">is answering one million voice questions per day we have almost a thousand applications that</p>
      <p begin="01:30:49.110" end="01:30:53.580">integrate with cortana voice commands and today there's a new cortana app store collection</p>
      <p begin="01:30:53.580" end="01:30:59.560">available so customers can check out some great examples we want to go even further and</p>
      <p begin="01:30:59.560" end="01:31:05.320">make a voice conversation with cortana as easy as a voice conversation with a human.</p>
      <p begin="01:31:05.320" end="01:31:09.760">So, I've got this beautiful all-in-one with a nice big-screen you can see at the top left</p>

      <p begin="01:31:15.850" end="01:31:19.700">is I don't know-how long it's going to take cortana can help me event hey cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:31:20.780" end="01:31:27.770">How long would take to get to sausalito?</p>
      <p begin="01:31:27.770" end="01:31:32.420">It will take twenty-seven minutes to drive to sausalito it's about twelve miles</p>
      <p begin="01:31:32.420" end="01:31:37.370">away all the things you expect to work in this experience on the lock screen I can play my</p>
      <p begin="01:31:37.370" end="01:31:42.120">music I can set alarm and this also gives a much bigger stage to let cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:31:42.120" end="01:31:44.270">is personality shine through.</p>
      <p begin="01:31:44.270" end="01:31:52.210">Hey, cortana will tell me a science joke.</p>

      <p begin="01:32:17.620" end="01:32:26.480">she helps me get stuff done here's an early preview of some new experiences that will release the coming months.</p>
      <p begin="01:32:26.480" end="01:32:28.570">Notice that cortana is coming to outlook and</p>
      <p begin="01:32:28.570" end="01:32:32.920">scheduled some appointments for me it's the blue with the circle.</p>
      <p begin="01:32:32.920" end="01:32:36.190">The idea there is cortana is now in outlook and</p>
      <p begin="01:32:36.190" end="01:32:39.780">she looking at my email and my calendar with my permission and</p>
      <p begin="01:32:39.780" end="01:32:44.470">helping me get things done stay on top of things a good example this week I was exchanging a bunch of</p>
      <p begin="01:32:44.470" end="01:32:49.180">email with our microsoft travel service trying to figure out the best time to get home on friday</p>
      <p begin="01:32:49.180" end="01:32:52.720">cortana is able to understand that conversation about me doing anything adding</p>
      <p begin="01:32:52.720" end="01:33:00.240">create appointment she automatically put all that flight information my counter to make it really easy for me to track.</p>
      <p begin="01:33:00.240" end="01:33:04.020">She applies the same conversational intelligence to help me stay on top of commitments</p>
      <p begin="01:33:04.020" end="01:33:08.570">in email I get a ton of email which makes it easy for me to forget things I said</p>
      <p begin="01:33:08.570" end="01:33:11.860">I would do so here cortana is flagged something I said</p>
      <p begin="01:33:11.860" end="01:33:16.740">semi manager today I was actually going to get ahead of this on the plane but the siren song of</p>

      <p begin="01:34:42.120" end="01:34:51.110">automatically shift to the appointment the free block of time I have there on thursday?</p>
      <p begin="01:34:51.110" end="01:34:55.080">Now since that meeting with ben is over lunch you can see here the cortana is brought</p>
      <p begin="01:34:55.080" end="01:34:59.970">in some proactive actions that she thinks can help me cortana has a team of experts</p>
      <p begin="01:34:59.970" end="01:35:04.910">that she relies on this idea that cortana doesn't need to know everything she can go and ask experts</p>
      <p begin="01:35:04.910" end="01:35:09.610">for health experts are all of you developers that are creating these amazing apps and services that can integrate</p>
      <p begin="01:35:09.610" end="01:35:14.450">right into cortana so the cases this meetings over lunch I might want to book a table</p>
      <p begin="01:35:14.450" end="01:35:18.910">we might not have time so I might need to bring in some food or she can offer some helpful</p>
      <p begin="01:35:18.910" end="01:35:24.140">suggestions about things to do here you can see a bunch of options city food tour sounds great</p>
      <p begin="01:35:24.140" end="01:35:29.460">here some information about that notice the option to buy tickets.</p>
      <p begin="01:35:29.460" end="01:35:34.390">Extensibility also means help me get that action done here create a very simple sample application</p>
      <p begin="01:35:34.390" end="01:35:39.280">city food tour notice cortana is passed in some context for me there are two of us in the meeting</p>
      <p begin="01:35:39.280" end="01:35:46.650">invite here some other information I can confirm my order now I've got tickets purchased.</p>
      <p begin="01:35:46.650" end="01:35:51.020">This same experience also works for business applications so the next time I go to cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:35:51.020" end="01:35:55.130">she's queuing up another thing she thinks I might want to work on in this case I took a taxi</p>
      <p begin="01:35:55.130" end="01:35:59.800">last night and cortana found out there was a receipt my email and she's</p>
      <p begin="01:35:59.800" end="01:36:03.970">offered to help me put that into my expense report we use the microsoft expense</p>
      <p begin="01:36:03.970" end="01:36:08.810">application internally to track this kind of thing when I click on that notice that all of the</p>
      <p begin="01:36:08.810" end="01:36:14.100">information and details map receipt are put into that application.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:14.100" end="01:36:20.210">And, I go ahead and add choose to save that.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:20.210" end="01:36:25.000">Since cortana is not bound to a particular device I can finish all these tasks here</p>
      <p begin="01:36:25.000" end="01:36:26.900">on my android phone.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:26.900" end="01:36:31.960">So, when I go ahead launch cortana?</p>
      <p begin="01:36:31.960" end="01:36:35.300">You can see that my meeting with ben is here and I got the tickets to the food city</p>
      <p begin="01:36:35.300" end="01:36:40.210">tours the microsoft expense application here I go ahead and choose to submit that</p>
      <p begin="01:36:41.510" end="01:36:45.940">and it's all taken care of since the phone as my most personal device</p>
      <p begin="01:36:45.940" end="01:36:50.890">its with me all the time cortana can augment me in very interesting ways so I</p>
      <p begin="01:36:50.890" end="01:36:54.980">have a five-year-old son and I started this tradition two years ago when I</p>
      <p begin="01:36:54.980" end="01:36:58.960">brought him home a toy from a business trip.</p>
      <p begin="01:36:58.960" end="01:37:03.100">Now every time daddy goes in a business trip little man thinks</p>
      <p begin="01:37:03.100" end="01:37:07.480">is birthday and daddy better deliver and bring home yet another toy I</p>
      <p begin="01:37:07.480" end="01:37:11.450">don't remember the name of the toy store that I went to last year was here but it</p>
      <p begin="01:37:11.450" end="01:37:19.290">had great transformers and things that he wants so since cortana is with me she can help enhance my memory.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:19.290" end="01:37:28.630">What toy store did I go to last year at build?</p>
      <p begin="01:37:28.630" end="01:37:34.160">You can see she finds the correct toy store again she brings in helpful proactive actions.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:34.160" end="01:37:38.850">Now let me show you how easy it is to create these actions.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:38.850" end="01:37:42.610">Here on the developer portal today we're announcing an invite-based preview</p>
      <p begin="01:37:42.610" end="01:37:49.180">for proactive actions and here's the portal that you can use to connect your apps and websites to cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:37:49.180" end="01:37:49.390">I want</p>

      <p begin="01:38:02.500" end="01:38:06.450">Instead of fumbling around trying to figure out how to send a text message and figure out what am I going to</p>
      <p begin="01:38:06.450" end="01:38:10.560">get there and I really going to get there at the time I think I can just send a glimpse which gives</p>
      <p begin="01:38:10.560" end="01:38:16.990">all the attendees real-time tracking of me with a map and tells me my expected eta.</p>

      <p begin="01:38:21.860" end="01:38:28.190">order dinner when you're working late let me show you how easy it was for just eat to configure the portal</p>
      <p begin="01:38:28.190" end="01:38:32.490">only a few steps the first thing you do is you go and add insights,</p>
      <p begin="01:38:32.490" end="01:38:36.220">insights control when cortana surfaces your action.</p>
      <p begin="01:38:36.220" end="01:38:41.060">That's this column right here this column is the contextual info this is the information that you want</p>
      <p begin="01:38:41.060" end="01:38:45.970">your app to request from customers so that just eat example just eat would like to know</p>
      <p begin="01:38:45.970" end="01:38:54.220">my cuisine preferences because they can do a much better job of give-me helpful suggestions if they knew that I love sushi.</p>
      <p begin="01:38:54.220" end="01:38:58.030">Customers are always in control of data that cortana shares so she's always going</p>
      <p begin="01:38:58.030" end="01:39:03.380">to ask permission before any data sent applications and services.</p>
      <p begin="01:39:03.380" end="01:39:07.690">Here the deep links that you create open your app these deep links are</p>
      <p begin="01:39:07.690" end="01:39:12.460">not restricted to a particular device a platform we support windows applications we</p>
      <p begin="01:39:12.460" end="01:39:19.100">support android applications ios applications are coming in the future and we also support websites.</p>
      <p begin="01:39:19.100" end="01:39:23.430">And, then finally some metadata that you ads that shows how the experience shows up</p>
      <p begin="01:39:23.430" end="01:39:31.080">in the cortana ui along with an icon.</p>
      <p begin="01:39:31.080" end="01:39:35.380">So, here you can see a sample appointment and both glimpse and just eat</p>
      <p begin="01:39:35.380" end="01:39:38.020">are here as actions it only take took just</p>
      <p begin="01:39:38.020" end="01:39:48.030">eat fifteen minutes to get their app registered to work in this experience.</p>
      <p begin="01:39:48.030" end="01:39:52.110">We're looking forward to seeing all the great ideas you have for integrating with cortana please request</p>

      <p begin="01:40:21.420" end="01:40:27.480">services and then register them as extensions and insights and action.</p>
      <p begin="01:40:27.480" end="01:40:30.400">So, we want to now move to another</p>
      <p begin="01:40:30.400" end="01:40:35.230">canvas another set of tools where conversations are taking place these</p>

      <p begin="01:46:06.970" end="01:46:10.470">These other used push talk because I didn't feel like typing.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:10.470" end="01:46:13.150">And, reilly everything your notice here is that cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:46:13.150" end="01:46:17.700">actually has context for my previous chat with gurdeep so even though I just told that the</p>
      <p begin="01:46:17.700" end="01:46:24.760">date it actually knows the location and, you know, that its from the conversation with gurdeep.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:24.760" end="01:46:29.320">Now cortana is proactively thinking about the next steps in coordinating my trip so</p>
      <p begin="01:46:29.320" end="01:46:33.840">she's actually suggesting that I connect with the westin bot anybody that knows me knows I normally stay at</p>
      <p begin="01:46:33.840" end="01:46:37.940">a westin bot and I'm so you see here now is cortana has actually</p>
      <p begin="01:46:37.940" end="01:46:41.930">introduced the westin bot into the conversation but not only has</p>
      <p begin="01:46:41.930" end="01:46:44.440">he done that she has given the westin bot</p>
      <p begin="01:46:44.440" end="01:46:48.990">context so I don't have to repeat myself the westin bot knows this is for dublin and</p>
      <p begin="01:46:48.990" end="01:46:54.830">its for those particular dates all of this saves me a lot of time and effort.</p>
      <p begin="01:46:54.830" end="01:47:00.950">Now there are suggested rooms I'm going to choose the normal room.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:00.950" end="01:47:04.980">Confirmation and just like that into simple steps I was able to</p>
      <p begin="01:47:04.980" end="01:47:17.830">block my calendar and also book my hotel room.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:17.830" end="01:47:26.860">Now there's nothing else the westin bot can do for me so I m going to say no thank you.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:26.860" end="01:47:31.330">And, now because cortana has all my relevant details the westin bot can actually leave the</p>
      <p begin="01:47:31.330" end="01:47:31.830">conversation.</p>
      <p begin="01:47:33.250" end="01:47:37.140">Now we're seeing a third aspect of cortana she knows my</p>
      <p begin="01:47:37.140" end="01:47:39.870">connections she knows who I communicate with</p>
      <p begin="01:47:39.870" end="01:47:44.850">so here you're seeing her actually suggest that when I go on this trip to dublin that I communicate with</p>
      <p begin="01:47:44.850" end="01:47:49.490">my friend jani and I see this card I could call her directly from here</p>
      <p begin="01:47:49.490" end="01:47:55.050">are video call her but I don't know what time it is so I'm going to choose to message her clicking that</p>
      <p begin="01:47:55.050" end="01:48:00.050">takes me to the conversation I have with jani the other thing you'll notice is that cortana because she has</p>
      <p begin="01:48:00.050" end="01:48:04.900">context about why I m pinging jani she's prepopulated the text</p>
      <p begin="01:48:04.900" end="01:48:15.160">with context around when I'm going to dublin and basically why I want to talk to her.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:15.160" end="01:48:22.000">And, fantastic jani is available and she's even going to show me around tab.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:22.000" end="01:48:25.590">So, this is just a glimpse into how skype and cortana</p>
      <p begin="01:48:25.590" end="01:48:39.810">powered by bing can make our conversations more productive informed and fine.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:39.810" end="01:48:44.750">Now as you now real-time video is a big part of how skype is used today</p>
      <p begin="01:48:44.750" end="01:48:49.100">I just showed you intelligence applied to messaging conversations and I now have the</p>
      <p begin="01:48:49.100" end="01:48:55.230">pleasure of announcing we will also be bringing intelligence into real-time video.</p>
      <p begin="01:48:55.230" end="01:48:59.420">Skype video baths will reinvent the way that friends family</p>
      <p begin="01:48:59.420" end="01:49:05.330">and businesses get together for the first-time we will enable a very personalized</p>
      <p begin="01:49:05.330" end="01:49:12.660">experience for you to connect with your favorite character business or</p>
      <p begin="01:49:12.660" end="01:49:15.570">And, the best part is that starting today</p>
      <p begin="01:49:15.570" end="01:49:26.880">developers will have access to our first ever skype bot sdk.</p>
      <p begin="01:49:26.880" end="01:49:31.610">And, as you can see there you can also sign up to one of our global hackathons we're starting with the first one in</p>
      <p begin="01:49:31.610" end="01:49:36.090">may which is happening here down in silicon valley and you'll be able</p>
      <p begin="01:49:36.090" end="01:49:39.580">to seamlessly integrate into chats like I showed you or even</p>
      <p begin="01:49:39.580" end="01:49:47.180">invent totally new audio and video experiences for an audience of millions.</p>
      <p begin="01:49:47.180" end="01:49:52.040">to make this even sweeter for developers as of today skype consumers will</p>
      <p begin="01:49:52.040" end="01:50:03.570">have access to bots in our latest windows ios and android apps.</p>
      <p begin="01:50:03.570" end="01:50:08.020">But, this is just the beginning with hololens becoming available we</p>
      <p begin="01:50:08.020" end="01:50:12.100">are also bringing intelligence into your virtual conversations</p>
      <p begin="01:50:13.810" end="01:50:18.910">with skype for hololens please roll video.</p>
      <p begin="01:51:41.220" end="01:51:45.920">Now the new seen what these rich conversational canvases as well</p>
      <p begin="01:51:45.920" end="01:51:49.820">as personal digital assistants can do for you.</p>
      <p begin="01:51:49.820" end="01:51:54.690">developers we think that this represents a huge opportunity for you</p>
      <p begin="01:51:54.690" end="01:51:59.370">to write new types of applications we want</p>
      <p begin="01:51:59.370" end="01:52:05.090">to empower all developers to do this new work that</p>
      <p begin="01:52:05.090" end="01:52:10.010">means we want every developer to build.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:10.010" end="01:52:11.510">Experts for cortana.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:12.740" end="01:52:16.610">We want every developer to be able to build.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:16.610" end="01:52:20.540">Bots as the new applications for every business</p>
      <p begin="01:52:20.540" end="01:52:26.480">and every service we want all developers to be able</p>
      <p begin="01:52:26.480" end="01:52:32.070">to infuse intelligence into their applications.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:32.070" end="01:52:35.830">to really make this possible we think of a new run-time.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:36.850" end="01:52:39.720">Which is this intelligence run time?</p>
      <p begin="01:52:39.720" end="01:52:45.420">That's all coming together as part of cortana intelligence suite.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:45.420" end="01:52:47.400">The runs on azure.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:47.400" end="01:52:49.880">That's going to have a rich bot</p>
      <p begin="01:52:49.880" end="01:52:54.490">framework a bot framework that will allow you to build.</p>
      <p begin="01:52:54.490" end="01:53:00.430">Rich dialogue capability into your application into your bot.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:00.430" end="01:53:04.980">A bot framework that will allow you not just to build bots for any one</p>
      <p begin="01:53:04.980" end="01:53:05.910">canvas</p>
      <p begin="01:53:05.910" end="01:53:12.560">we don't envision such a world we envision a world of many conversational canvas.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:12.560" end="01:53:17.810">So, you will be able to take the bot framework and in fact integrate with all of</p>
      <p begin="01:53:17.810" end="01:53:24.720">slack skype line outlook all of the canvases.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:24.720" end="01:53:27.540">We also want to give you a set of micro</p>
      <p begin="01:53:27.540" end="01:53:32.150">services these cognitive services so that you can have language understanding</p>
      <p begin="01:53:32.150" end="01:53:37.050">speech understanding computer vision built into your applications and</p>
      <p begin="01:53:37.050" end="01:53:41.040">also rich machine learning capability because we think</p>
      <p begin="01:53:41.040" end="01:53:45.030">of this intelligence run time and cortana intelligence</p>
      <p begin="01:53:45.030" end="01:53:51.190">suite is going to be core just like how the dot net run times were.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:51.190" end="01:53:54.390">To all the applications that you're going to build going forward.</p>
      <p begin="01:53:55.570" end="01:54:00.400">And, to give you a glimpse of this world and what cortana intelligence suite</p>
      <p begin="01:54:00.400" end="01:54:05.140">can enable warning white up onstage my colleague dan lili as well</p>
      <p begin="01:54:05.140" end="01:54:09.810">as cornelia to give you a sense for what development looks like with these new set of tools</p>
      <p begin="01:54:09.810" end="01:54:16.950">and micro services dan first new thanks satya?</p>
      <p begin="01:54:16.950" end="01:54:20.880">In today's demos of windows cortana and skype we've shown you how</p>
      <p begin="01:54:20.880" end="01:54:24.520">microsoft is creating new conversational experiences if</p>
      <p begin="01:54:24.520" end="01:54:27.500">you're developer or business professional you may want to add</p>
      <p begin="01:54:27.500" end="01:54:32.200">bots and conversations your own products and we want to share our services and open</p>
      <p begin="01:54:32.200" end="01:54:36.300">source our tools so you can use them to build your own great bots.</p>
      <p begin="01:54:36.300" end="01:54:39.270">So, today I m so excited to introduce a brand-new</p>
      <p begin="01:54:39.270" end="01:54:49.160">platform for creating intelligent and connected bots the microsoft bot framework.</p>
      <p begin="01:54:49.160" end="01:54:54.110">What are you're building a simple tick-tack-toe bot creating a productivity bot to make your business smarter</p>
      <p begin="01:54:54.110" end="01:54:58.990">or faster or adding conversation to an existing brand like you saw with the westin bot the</p>
      <p begin="01:54:58.990" end="01:55:03.410">microsoft bot framework has everything you need to get your bot stocking?</p>
      <p begin="01:55:03.410" end="01:55:06.320">Let me give you an introduction.</p>
      <p begin="01:55:06.320" end="01:55:10.450">If you've already got a bot the microsoft bot framework can seamlessly connect that bots</p>
      <p begin="01:55:10.450" end="01:55:16.910">as users on skype slack telegram sms email and more.</p>
      <p begin="01:55:16.910" end="01:55:18.080">Don't have a bot</p>
      <p begin="01:55:18.080" end="01:55:22.890">our open source bot builder sdk available on github has everything you need to give your</p>
      <p begin="01:55:22.890" end="01:55:27.820">node dot js or csharp based bot great dialoging conversation skills</p>
      <p begin="01:55:27.820" end="01:55:33.410">and also makes it easy to integrate natural language processing and machine learning services coming</p>
      <p begin="01:55:33.410" end="01:55:38.380">soon our bot directory will contain many fantastic bots written using the bot framework</p>
      <p begin="01:55:38.380" end="01:55:43.010">including the build bot which is available to give you information about the build event like session</p>
      <p begin="01:55:43.010" end="01:55:47.200">information nearby restaurants and more but</p>
      <p begin="01:55:47.200" end="01:55:51.810">I'm a developer and I'm really excited to show you how easy it is to write code using the microsoft</p>
      <p begin="01:55:51.810" end="01:55:56.700">bot framework to show you what it's like I put together a simple bot that orders me pizza from</p>
      <p begin="01:55:56.700" end="01:56:03.820">domino's this is going to be great you're going to get to see some code and I get order myself lunch?</p>
      <p begin="01:56:03.820" end="01:56:06.710">Here's the source code for my bot when a user sends my</p>
      <p begin="01:56:06.710" end="01:56:11.130">bottom message the bot framework calls into this method right here and if user said</p>
      <p begin="01:56:11.130" end="01:56:15.810">slashed order we drop into this block of code were first I put together my pizza</p>
      <p begin="01:56:15.810" end="01:56:20.600">medium hand-tossed with spinach and mushrooms then I put that pizza into an order of</p>
      <p begin="01:56:20.600" end="01:56:27.580">specified the delivery address and the credit card that I found.</p>
      <p begin="01:56:27.580" end="01:56:32.020">That's a satya assures me use buying and then I place the order to</p>
      <p begin="01:56:32.020" end="01:56:36.660">dominoes secure rest api now since I'm dealing with a credit card I don't</p>
      <p begin="01:56:36.660" end="01:56:39.660">want don't transmit that and plain-text so I want to make sure</p>
      <p begin="01:56:39.660" end="01:56:44.180">that's commit sent securely over secure channel</p>
      <p begin="01:56:44.180" end="01:56:49.720">tryout our bot I'm going to show you my bots webpage in our bot directory.</p>
      <p begin="01:56:49.720" end="01:56:53.060">Now it can be really hard to try out new bots so as part of the bot framework</p>
      <p begin="01:56:53.060" end="01:56:56.770">we've included a reusable and secure will chat control that developers can</p>
      <p begin="01:56:56.770" end="01:57:00.340">put in their own webpages so customers can talk directly with their bots.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:00.340" end="01:57:05.160">Straight out of say hi to my bot and a respond if I</p>
      <p begin="01:57:05.160" end="01:57:15.810">says such order will take just a second and there we go my orders on its way.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:15.810" end="01:57:19.400">This is great for simple bots but interesting bots need real dialogue</p>
      <p begin="01:57:19.400" end="01:57:23.640">and language skills that they can hold a real conversation I want my bot to be able to</p>
      <p begin="01:57:23.640" end="01:57:27.740">excepted an order from a real customer where they can specify the size of their pizza the</p>
      <p begin="01:57:27.740" end="01:57:32.150">toppings and more and you heard such talk about trustworthiness it's important for</p>
      <p begin="01:57:32.150" end="01:57:38.090">robot to get the users permission before actually sends the order on its way to dominoes now this is</p>
      <p begin="01:57:38.090" end="01:57:42.460">were a bot builder sdk really shines our bot builder sdk is available in node dot</p>
      <p begin="01:57:42.460" end="01:57:46.750">js and csharp but I'm writing in csharp so I'll show you that.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:46.750" end="01:57:51.570">Use our bot builder sdk I'm just going to remove the existing simple bot code</p>
      <p begin="01:57:51.570" end="01:57:54.640">that I've got an ad in a couple of lines here.</p>
      <p begin="01:57:55.650" end="01:57:58.130">And, then up at the top of configured the bot builder</p>
      <p begin="01:57:58.130" end="01:58:03.450">sdk so, the my bot talks the way I want to I've added welcome message a</p>
      <p begin="01:58:03.450" end="01:58:08.380">confirmation prompt and then actually added in the code place the order</p>
      <p begin="01:58:08.380" end="01:58:12.530">the bot builder sdk does all the work of walking my user through filling in my</p>
      <p begin="01:58:12.530" end="01:58:16.160">up the object that represents my pizza which are defined as a</p>
      <p begin="01:58:16.160" end="01:58:22.440">plain csharp object with a few annotations now next we're going to actually connect my</p>
      <p begin="01:58:22.440" end="01:58:26.110">bot to users so I'm going to go to my bots dashboard in the developed</p>
      <p begin="01:58:26.110" end="01:58:30.460">in our developer portal in the bot framework a you can see here it's</p>
      <p begin="01:58:30.460" end="01:58:35.310">easy to connect my bot up to services like skype slack telegram</p>
      <p begin="01:58:35.310" end="01:58:40.350">and others we bought the bot framework to be an open platform so we include many third-party</p>
      <p begin="01:58:40.350" end="01:58:45.350">services including pervasive services like sms which are accessible worldwide</p>
      <p begin="01:58:45.350" end="01:58:54.330">and available even on inexpensive devices like this fourteen dollar mobile phone.</p>
      <p begin="01:58:54.330" end="01:58:59.250">Now we're really excited to introduce the bot framework or even more excited to see the kinds of things</p>
      <p begin="01:58:59.250" end="01:59:02.590">you write using it we have a session coming up immediately after the keynote at</p>
      <p begin="01:59:02.590" end="01:59:07.350">eleven thirty were walk you through the process of building a conversational bot from zero to sixty</p>
      <p begin="01:59:07.350" end="01:59:12.330">using the bot framework hope to see there are up next I like to introduce lili tang</p>
      <p begin="01:59:12.330" end="01:59:24.910">is going to give you a sneak peek at some upcoming intelligent tools coming to the bot framework in the future.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:24.910" end="01:59:27.080">So, as dan said I'm going to give you a sneak</p>
      <p begin="01:59:27.080" end="01:59:36.140">peek at some tools we the experimenting with to help you build your bot sprayed.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:36.140" end="01:59:37.990">All right so here I have</p>
      <p begin="01:59:37.990" end="01:59:45.280">my chat control and I can type in please send me a large pepperoni pizza.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:45.280" end="01:59:49.500">And, you can see that my bot understands the size and toppings</p>
      <p begin="01:59:49.500" end="01:59:52.560">ask me to clarify what kind of crust I want.</p>
      <p begin="01:59:52.560" end="01:59:55.960">Now in order to do this your bot needs to understand natural</p>
      <p begin="01:59:55.960" end="02:00:00.900">language so as you begin before you have real users using your bot</p>
      <p begin="02:00:00.900" end="02:00:03.770">the before you have real user response data we</p>
      <p begin="02:00:03.770" end="02:00:13.690">provided some simple tools to help you build your natural language rules let's take a look.</p>
      <p begin="02:00:13.690" end="02:00:15.890">All right so these are the rules behind my bot</p>
      <p begin="02:00:15.890" end="02:00:20.750">brain just like dan showed you except we providing you why</p>
      <p begin="02:00:20.750" end="02:00:25.550">do make them a little bit easier to read so if you look at the first rule it</p>
      <p begin="02:00:25.550" end="02:00:30.500">matches responses such as deliver me some quantity of</p>
      <p begin="02:00:30.500" end="02:00:41.210">some size pizza a with some kind of topping that's pretty cool right.</p>
      <p begin="02:00:41.210" end="02:00:45.650">So, I can just click into the deliver blurb to understand it more and here you</p>
      <p begin="02:00:45.650" end="02:00:50.580">can see that not only the word deliver triggers the verb but also order and</p>
      <p begin="02:00:50.580" end="02:00:53.680">by so that's pretty cool too.</p>
      <p begin="02:00:53.680" end="02:00:57.960">But, what if people use other words?</p>
      <p begin="02:00:57.960" end="02:01:02.870">Because we mine the web and understand language things like verb</p>
      <p begin="02:01:02.870" end="02:01:07.740">tense translation into other language common misspellings we can help</p>
      <p begin="02:01:07.740" end="02:01:11.330">you by providing you some suggestions for synonyms.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:11.330" end="02:01:14.790">All you need to do is click.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:14.790" end="02:01:19.980">Select once you once.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:19.980" end="02:01:28.450">And, you expanded dictionary really easy.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:28.450" end="02:01:33.030">What else is great is if I have other bots like the cupcake bot that lilian</p>
      <p begin="02:01:33.030" end="02:01:39.250">showed you earlier I can share these dictionaries across my various bots?</p>
      <p begin="02:01:39.250" end="02:01:43.710">Now rules are great and critical for getting started but as you</p>
      <p begin="02:01:43.710" end="02:01:48.240">start getting more and more users and more and more response data rules can</p>
      <p begin="02:01:48.240" end="02:01:55.370">be very complex to manage and this is where we provide you with another tool.</p>
      <p begin="02:01:55.370" end="02:01:58.220">Here we use machine learning</p>
      <p begin="02:01:58.220" end="02:02:02.440">and deep learning to create your conversation model.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:02.440" end="02:02:06.890">So, building upon what I just showed you we automatically add</p>
      <p begin="02:02:06.890" end="02:02:11.700">your semantic dictionary and your rules we also make it really easy for you to upload</p>
      <p begin="02:02:11.700" end="02:02:16.570">additional training data to get started now we know.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:17.620" end="02:02:21.260">That people can be very unpredictable as they user bots.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:22.400" end="02:02:24.190">So, here you can see a</p>
      <p begin="02:02:24.190" end="02:02:31.380">user has said can you deliver three large pepperoni pizzas to my crib.</p>
      <p begin="02:02:31.380" end="02:02:36.130">So, you're laughing so, you know, and, I know that my crib is slang for</p>
      <p begin="02:02:36.130" end="02:02:40.660">house but the system doesn't know that so it's really easy for me if I</p>
      <p begin="02:02:40.660" end="02:02:46.320">think it's appropriate to tag it as a location and</p>
      <p begin="02:02:46.320" end="02:02:51.910">save so it's that easy to help teach your bot and help</p>
      <p begin="02:02:51.910" end="02:02:56.170">become smarter and you don't need to be a data science expert in</p>
      <p begin="02:02:56.170" end="02:02:59.990">fact you don't even really need to know how to code to help your bot improve.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:01.160" end="02:03:07.810">So, that's pretty cool right.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:07.810" end="02:03:10.320">All right so finally we</p>
      <p begin="02:03:10.320" end="02:03:15.160">know intelligent systems have their limitations so here I take send me</p>
      <p begin="02:03:15.160" end="02:03:23.090">a large pepperoni pizza a to moscone a that too.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:23.090" end="02:03:26.920">Eric and here my body's telling me I don't understand.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:28.050" end="02:03:31.510">And, what it can do for tasks that are rare complex?</p>
      <p begin="02:03:34.230" end="02:03:38.180">Or just that it doesn't understand it can automatically escalate</p>
      <p begin="02:03:38.180" end="02:03:42.410">to a person and this is something that we think is a great example of</p>
      <p begin="02:03:42.410" end="02:03:45.780">what satya mentioned earlier to combine what people do</p>
      <p begin="02:03:45.780" end="02:03:55.240">best with the intelligent system so let's take a look at what the worker might see.</p>
      <p begin="02:03:55.240" end="02:03:58.530">All right so here as I'm working</p>
      <p begin="02:03:58.530" end="02:04:03.260">the system in real time is automatically suggesting me responses and you can</p>
      <p begin="02:04:03.260" end="02:04:07.950">see those responses below my text entry in the chat window.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:07.950" end="02:04:10.230">And, then on the side the system</p>
      <p begin="02:04:10.230" end="02:04:15.120">is automatically pre-filling my order form based on what it knows.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:15.120" end="02:04:19.740">Now I can see here the system has incorrectly</p>
      <p begin="02:04:19.740" end="02:04:26.820">classified moscone is a person so all I need to do it again is click.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:26.820" end="02:04:30.570">Correct the annotation and save it.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:30.570" end="02:04:33.970">The system prompts me to clarify that its moscone</p>
      <p begin="02:04:33.970" end="02:04:38.630">center and again my suggested response is update I can just click</p>
      <p begin="02:04:38.630" end="02:04:50.580">and enter to have to facilitate my interaction with my customer.</p>
      <p begin="02:04:50.580" end="02:04:53.240">So, this is exciting because while working I can</p>
      <p begin="02:04:53.240" end="02:04:56.950">continue to teach my bot without needing to know</p>
      <p begin="02:04:56.950" end="02:05:03.300">natural language machine learning deep learning or even coding.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:03.300" end="02:05:06.610">All of my input can make the system more intelligent and</p>
      <p begin="02:05:06.610" end="02:05:09.900">the intelligent system can help me get my work done more effectively</p>
      <p begin="02:05:11.150" end="02:05:15.790">that's it for my sneak peek we know we have a lot to learn.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:15.790" end="02:05:27.010">As we continue to experiment and make we will make these tools more broadly available.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:27.010" end="02:05:31.330">And, of course as you've already heard you can get started today with both</p>
      <p begin="02:05:31.330" end="02:05:35.420">the bot framework that dan showed you earlier to build and connect your bot</p>
      <p begin="02:05:35.420" end="02:05:37.250">to places people connect</p>
      <p begin="02:05:37.250" end="02:05:41.480">skype bot tools and also cornelia is up next to show you the</p>
      <p begin="02:05:41.480" end="02:05:48.400">new cognitive services which will help make your tools more intelligent thank you.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:48.400" end="02:05:51.320">Thank you lili.</p>
      <p begin="02:05:51.320" end="02:05:53.770">Ria hello everybody in a</p>
      <p begin="02:05:53.770" end="02:05:58.380">year ago we introduced the first portfolio of intelligent services</p>
      <p begin="02:05:58.380" end="02:06:02.810">from microsoft we had five apis for you to go use</p>
      <p begin="02:06:02.810" end="02:06:05.810">and add intelligence to your apps.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:05.810" end="02:06:10.370">Well, today I want to introduce you to microsoft dot com slash cognitive</p>
      <p begin="02:06:10.370" end="02:06:15.070">our new portfolio of intelligent services and we have twenty-two</p>
      <p begin="02:06:15.070" end="02:06:19.590">apis for you to get started with for free today.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:19.590" end="02:06:22.860">We have apis we have apis</p>
      <p begin="02:06:22.860" end="02:06:28.960">across vision from image to video understanding speech.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:28.960" end="02:06:30.560">Language understanding apis.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:31.790" end="02:06:32.820">Knowledge apis.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:33.830" end="02:06:37.560">And, of course search apis through bing</p>
      <p begin="02:06:37.560" end="02:06:41.970">twenty-two apis for you to get started with this is years</p>
      <p begin="02:06:41.970" end="02:06:46.610">of machine learning and ai research from microsoft ready for you to use</p>
      <p begin="02:06:46.610" end="02:06:54.140">at your fingertips now you can just samoa.</p>
      <p begin="02:06:54.140" end="02:06:58.420">You can just imagine all the cool stuff you can build with these apis and to showcase what's</p>
      <p begin="02:06:58.420" end="02:07:02.650">possible I'm going to show you a handful of demos the first</p>
      <p begin="02:07:02.650" end="02:07:07.470">I'll show you is a quick app we put together all I need to do in</p>
      <p begin="02:07:07.470" end="02:07:12.160">this app is either take a photo or upload some image url logistic</p>
      <p begin="02:07:12.160" end="02:07:16.980">this desk here and use that it calls into the new vision apis and</p>
      <p begin="02:07:16.980" end="02:07:26.990">what that is able to do is able to recognize objects in the image?</p>
      <p begin="02:07:26.990" end="02:07:31.690">There are thousands of objects we can recognize and we also give you a confidence score if</p>
      <p begin="02:07:31.690" end="02:07:36.690">the confidence is low, you know, we're not quite sure if for seeing what we say we're seeing if the</p>
      <p begin="02:07:36.690" end="02:07:41.680">confidence is high you can probably take it for real.</p>
      <p begin="02:07:41.680" end="02:07:46.760">Now it's cool we have object recognition we can take it a step further and role show you</p>
      <p begin="02:07:46.760" end="02:07:52.250">in my next demo we can take it a step further by not just recognizing objects but also figuring</p>
      <p begin="02:07:52.250" end="02:07:56.940">out the relationships behind them and then using natural language to create</p>
      <p begin="02:07:56.940" end="02:08:00.440">a coherent description of what you're seeing in the image.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:01.480" end="02:08:05.450">This is caption bot that ai and you them aware side we're going to allow you to</p>
      <p begin="02:08:05.450" end="02:08:09.920">play with today I went in earlier picked up a couple of random images</p>
      <p begin="02:08:09.920" end="02:08:15.520">off of bing and now let's see what our little caption bot signal to say</p>
      <p begin="02:08:15.520" end="02:08:20.090">its thinks it's a herd of cattle standing on a dry grass field I love the fact</p>
      <p begin="02:08:20.090" end="02:08:24.560">that it gives the vocabulary right that doesn't say group of cattle or group of animals no it's a</p>
      <p begin="02:08:24.560" end="02:08:31.690">herd of cattle and it also sees that it's a dry grass field.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:31.690" end="02:08:36.350">This is the mona lisa as most of you here now let's see what.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:36.350" end="02:08:41.350">Our little caption bot can do.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:41.350" end="02:08:46.160">All right so trips of its as I'm not really confident but I think if we have a heart</p>
      <p begin="02:08:46.160" end="02:08:52.580">of the vinci sitting in front of the mirror and he seems neutral faced.</p>
      <p begin="02:08:52.580" end="02:08:57.110">This goes to show you our bot wasn't taught any art so then it doesn't</p>
      <p begin="02:08:57.110" end="02:09:01.850">recognize the masters of the renaissance of their masterpieces we haven't</p>
      <p begin="02:09:01.850" end="02:09:06.780">shown it any of that data we've only shown it landscapes and gatherings and,</p>
      <p begin="02:09:06.780" end="02:09:10.830">you know, your average day-to-day life to learn from.</p>
      <p begin="02:09:10.830" end="02:09:15.610">And, I showed you this example to show just how important data is when you are</p>
      <p begin="02:09:15.610" end="02:09:20.820">trying to take advantage of these machine learning a services an apis and</p>
      <p begin="02:09:20.820" end="02:09:25.200">we're working on allowing you to bring your own data to these algorithms</p>
      <p begin="02:09:25.200" end="02:09:29.240">and customize them for your needs.</p>
      <p begin="02:09:29.240" end="02:09:32.630">Which frankly into my third demo?</p>
      <p begin="02:09:32.630" end="02:09:38.390">This demo is a quick little app that we put together to show you a service we call</p>
      <p begin="02:09:38.390" end="02:09:43.080">Custom recognition intelligent service it allows you to bring any audio</p>
      <p begin="02:09:43.080" end="02:09:47.860">files and customize our speech-to-text technology that's already shipped in</p>
      <p begin="02:09:47.860" end="02:09:51.890">products like cortana and bing so if your scenario</p>
      <p begin="02:09:51.890" end="02:09:56.400">calls for audio that has a lot of background noise think of,</p>
      <p begin="02:09:56.400" end="02:10:01.220">you know, a busy drive-through and you're trying to understand what you're customers ordering or think, you</p>
      <p begin="02:10:01.220" end="02:10:06.140">know, you're trying to understand what people with heavy romanian accents like me are trying to say</p>
      <p begin="02:10:06.140" end="02:10:11.090">well you bring those files and you're able to train the speech-to-text algorithms</p>
      <p begin="02:10:11.090" end="02:10:17.450">to have higher precision for your scenarios what I'm showing you here is an example that we</p>
      <p begin="02:10:17.450" end="02:10:21.820">trained with child speech and I hope the audio is hooked up because it's important to realize</p>
      <p begin="02:10:21.820" end="02:10:26.710">just how bad the audio can be here and the difference between speech regular speech-to-text versus</p>
      <p begin="02:10:26.710" end="02:10:31.950">cris left side shows you regular speech-to-text right side is</p>
      <p begin="02:10:31.950" end="02:10:38.080">cris and now let's see what our system is able to recognize.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:38.080" end="02:10:40.850">Chance like large bash.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:40.850" end="02:10:46.940">They use case badge collects star.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:46.940" end="02:10:52.490">We had some kids here read a book about giants and you can clearly see that cris gets</p>
      <p begin="02:10:52.490" end="02:10:58.520">kids not talking about dancing is talking about giants and the fact that they love large bags.</p>
      <p begin="02:10:58.520" end="02:10:59.020">No.</p>
      <p begin="02:11:01.360" end="02:11:04.970">Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="02:11:04.970" end="02:11:09.720">Now these demos are all fun I'm going to finish up by showing showing you a real</p>
      <p begin="02:11:09.720" end="02:11:13.220">customer scenario witti globe is a</p>
